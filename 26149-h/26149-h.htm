<h2>LEFT GUARD GILBERT</h2>



<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE BOY FROM KANSAS</h3>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Hold</span> up!"</div>

<p>Coach Robey, coatless, vestless, hatless, his old
flannel trousers held up as by a miracle with the
aid of a leather strap scarcely deserving the name
of belt, pushed his way through the first squad
players. The Brimfield Head Coach was a wiry,
medium-sized man of about thirty, with a deeply-tanned
face from which sharp blue eyes looked
out under whitish lashes that were a shade lighter
than his eyebrows and two shades lighter than
his sandy hair. As the afternoon was excessively
hot, even for the twenty-first day of September
and in proximity to Long Island Sound, Mr.
George Robey's countenance was bathed in perspiration
and the faded blue silk shirt was plastered
to his body.</p>

<p>"That was left half through guard-tackle,
wasn't it? Then don't put the ball in your arm,
St. Clair. You ought to know better than that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
On plays through the line hold it against your
stomach with both hands. How long do you think
you'd keep that ball in your elbow after you hit
the line? Someone would knock it out in about
one second! Now try it again and think what
you're doing. All right, Carmine. Same play."</p>

<p>The panting and perspiring backs crouched once
more, Carmine shrilly called his signals, Thayer
and Gafferty plunged against an imaginary foe
as Thursby shot the ball back and St. Clair, hugging
the pigskin ecstatically with wide-spread
fingers, trotted through the hole, stopped, set the
ball on the grass and wiped his streaming face
with the torn sleeve of a maroon jersey.</p>

<p>"All right," said the coach. "That will do for
today. In on the trot, everyone!"</p>

<p>The first squad, exhaling a long, deep sigh of
relief as one man, set their faces toward the gymnasium
and trotted slowly off, their canvas-clad
legs <i>swish-swashing</i> as they met. Coach Robey
walked further down the sun-baked field to where
the nearer of the remaining four squads was at
work.</p>

<p>"Oh, put some pep into it, McPhee!" called the
coach as he approached. "You all look as if you
were asleep! Come on now! Wake up! Jones,
get up there. You're away out of position. That's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
better. Now then, Quarter! Hold up! What's
your down?"</p>

<p>"Third, sir, and four to go."</p>

<p>"All right. Show me what you're going to do
with it. Head up, Martin! Look where you're
going."</p>

<p>"36&mdash;27&mdash;43&mdash;86!" grunted the quarter-back.
"36&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Signal!" cried Gordon, at right half.</p>

<p>McPhee straightened, cast a withering look at
the half-back, wiped the perspiration from the end
of his sun-burnt nose and repeated:</p>

<p>"36&mdash;27&mdash;43&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gordon shifted his feet, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold up!" barked the coach. "Gordon, don't
give the play away. Shifting your feet like that
makes it a cinch for the other fellow. Get your
position now and hold it until the ball's passed.
All right. Once more, Quarter."</p>

<p>"36&mdash;27&mdash;43&mdash;86!" wailed McPhee. "36&mdash;27&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The pigskin shot into his waiting hands, Gordon
leaped forward, took it at a hand-pass and
ran out behind his line, left half in advance, turned
sharply in and set the ball down.</p>

<p>"First down!" called McPhee. "Sturges
over."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold up! Try a forward pass, McPhee.
You're on the ten yards and it's third down. Get
into this, you ends. Put some pep into it!"</p>

<p>"Signal! Martin back! 37&mdash;32&mdash;14&mdash;71&mdash;Hep!"
The backs jumped to the left one stride.
"37&mdash;32&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Back flew the ball to the full-back, right end
shot out and down the field across the mythical
last line, the defence surged against the imaginary
enemy and Martin, poising the ball at arm's
length, threw over the line to Lee.</p>

<p>"All right," commented the coach. "That'll be
all for today. Trot all the way in, fellows."</p>

<p>Five minutes later the field was empty of the
sixty-odd boys who had reported for the second
day's practice and the sun was going down behind
the tree-clad hill to the west. In the gymnasium
was the sound of rushing water, of many voices
and of scraping benches. Mr. Robey wormed his
way through the crowded locker-room to where
Danny Moore, the trainer, stood in the doorway
of the rubbing-room in talk with Jim Morton, this
year's manager of the team. Morton was nineteen,
tall, thin and benevolent looking behind a
pair of rubber-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>"Did you put them on the scales, Dan?" asked
the coach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure, the first, second and third, sir. Some
of 'em dropped a good three pounds today. By
gorry, I feel like I'd dropped that much meself!"</p>

<p>"It certainly is warm. Look here, Jim, is this
all we get to work on? How many were out today?"</p>

<p>"Sixty-two, Coach. That's not bad. I suppose
there'll be a few more dribble along tomorrow and
the next day."</p>

<p>"Well, they look pretty fair, don't you think?
Some of the new fellows seem to have ideas of
football. All the last year fellows on hand?"</p>

<p>"All but Gilbert. He hasn't shown up. I don't
know why, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Better look him up," said the coach. "Gilbert
ought to make a pretty good showing this year,
and we aren't any too strong on guards."</p>

<p>"Gilbert rooms with Tim Otis, I think," replied
Morton. "Oh, Tim! Tim Otis!"</p>

<p>A light-haired boy of seventeen, very straight,
and very pink where an enormous bath-towel
failed to cover him, wormed his way to them.</p>

<p>"Say, Tim, what's the matter with Gilbert?"
asked Morton. "Isn't he coming out?"</p>

<p>Tim Otis shrugged a pair of broad, lean shoulders.
"He hasn't got here yet, Morton. I don't
know what's happened. He wrote me two weeks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
ago that he'd meet me at the station in New
York yesterday for the three-fifty-eight, but he
wasn't there and I haven't heard a word from
him."</p>

<p>"Probably missed his connection," suggested
Morton. "He lives out West somewhere,
doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Osawatomie, Kansas."</p>

<p>"It probably takes a good while to get away
from a place with a name like that," said
Mr. Robey drily. "Well, when he shows up,
Otis, tell him to get a move on if he wants a
place."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I will. I'm pretty certain he will be
along today some time. I wouldn't be surprised if
he was here now."</p>

<p>"All right. By the way, Otis, how do you feel
at right half? Seem strange to you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I don't notice it. I did play right, you
know, two years ago on the second. Seems to me
it's easier to take the ball from that position, too."</p>

<p>"Well, don't try the fool trick your side-partner
did today," said Mr. Robey, smiling. "Putting
the ball under your elbow for a line plunge is a
fine piece of business for a fellow who's been playing
three years!"</p>

<p>Tim laughed. "I guess he did that because it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
was just practice, sir. He knows a lot better than
to do it in scrimmage."</p>

<p>"I hope so. Well, hurry Gilbert along, will
you? If he doesn't get out here inside of a few
days he won't find much of a welcome, I'm afraid.
I'm not going to keep positions open for anyone
this year, not with the first game coming along in
four days!"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Mr. Robey," replied Tim,
with a chuckle and a flash of white teeth. "I'll
have him out here the first day he shows up,
even if I have to lug him all the way. Don't
think I'll have to, though, for you couldn't
keep Don from playing football unless you tied
him up!"</p>

<p>"Nice chap," commented Morton, nodding at
Tim as the latter returned to his bench. "Awfully
clean-cut sort."</p>

<p>"A fine lad," agreed Danny Moore, and Mr.
Robey nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I don't believe we're going to miss Kendall
and Freer as much as I thought," he said after
a moment. "Otis looks to me like a fellow who
will stand a lot of work and grow on it. Well, I'm
going to get a shower and get out of this sweat-box.
As soon as you get time, Jim, I wish you'd
catalogue the players the way we did last year and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
let me have the list. You know how Black did it,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I'll have the list ready for you tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Good! Got a towel I can use, Dan? I haven't
brought any yet. Thanks." The coach nodded
and sought a place to disrobe. The trainer's gaze
followed him until he was lost to sight beyond the
throng.</p>

<p>"I wonder will he put it over again this year,"
he mused.</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know," asserted Morton.
"Think I'm going to have the team licked the year
I'm manager, Danny? Not so you'd notice it!"</p>

<p>"Well, between you and him," chuckled Danny,
"I've no doubt you'll turn out a fine team. Say,
he's the lad that can do it, though, now ain't he?
Four years he's been at it, and it's fifty-fifty now,
ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we lost the first two years and won last
year and the year before. It was Andy Miller's
team that started the ball rolling for us. No one
could have won those first two years, anyhow,
Danny. Robey had to start at the bottom and
build up the whole thing. We hadn't been playing
football here for several years before that. It
takes a couple of years at the least to get a foundation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
laid. If we win this year we'll have something
to boast of. No other team ever beat
Claflin three times running."</p>

<p>"Maybe we won't either. I'm hoping we do,
though. Still and all, it don't do to win too many
times. You get to thinking you can't lose, d'ye
see, and the first thing anyone knows you're all
shot to pieces. I've seen it happen, me boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say, Danny, but don't let's start the
losing streak until next year. I want to manage
a winning team. Well, so long. See about some
cooler weather tomorrow, will you?"</p>

<p>"I will so," replied the little trainer gravely.
"I'll start arrangements to once."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tim Otis, again arrayed in grey
flannels and a pair of tan, rubber-soled shoes
rather the worse for a hard summer, was on his
way along the Row to the last of the five buildings
set end to end on the brow of the hill. As he
swung in between Wendell and Torrence&mdash;the
gymnasium stood behind Wendell, and, save for
the Cottage, as the principal's residence was
called, was the only building out of alignment&mdash;he
saw the entrances to dormitories and Main Hall
thronged with youths who evidently preferred the
coolness of outdoors to the heat of the rooms,
while others were seated on the grass along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
walk. It almost seemed that the entire roster of
some one hundred and eighty students was before
him. He answered many hails, but declined all
inducements to tarry, keeping on his way past
Main Hall and Hensey until Billings was reached.
There he turned in and tramped to the right along
the first floor corridor to the open door of Number
6, a room on the back of the building that looked
out upon the tennis courts and, beyond, the football
and baseball fields. From the fact that no
sound came from the room, Tim decided that Don
Gilbert had, after all, and in spite of what Tim
called a "hunch," failed to arrive. But when he
entered his mistake was instantly apparent. A
maroon-coloured cushion hurtled toward him, narrowly
missing the green shade of the droplight
on the study table and, thanks to prompt and instinctive
action on the part of Tim, sailed on,
serene and unimpeded, into the corridor. Whereupon
Tim uttered a savage whoop of mingled joy
and vengeance and, traversing the length of the
room in four leaps, hurled himself upon the occupant
of the window-seat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>IN NUMBER SIX</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">For</span> a long minute confusion and the noise of
battle reigned supreme. Then, in response to a
sudden yelp of pain from Don, Tim drew off, panting
and grinning. Don was extending a left hand,
funereally wrapped in a black silk handkerchief,
further along the window-seat and away from the
scene of action.</div>

<p>"Hello!" said Tim. "What's the matter with
that?"</p>

<p>"Hurt it a little," replied Don.</p>

<p>"Well, I supposed you had, you idiot! How?
Hit it against your head?"</p>

<p>The other smiled in his slow fashion. "We had
a sort of a wreck coming on. Out in Indiana somewhere.
I got this. That's why I'm behind
time."</p>

<p>"I'm beastly sorry, old man! I didn't notice
the cr&ecirc;pe. Did I hurt it much!"</p>

<p>"No. I yelled so you wouldn't. Preparedness,
you know. Safety first and so on. It isn't much.
How's everything here?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Tim seated himself at the other end of the seat,
took his knees in his hands, and beamed.</p>

<p>"Oh, fine! Say, I'm tickled to death to see your
ugly mug again, Don. You aren't a bit handsomer,
are you?"</p>

<p>"I've been told I was. Trouble with you is, you
don't recognise manly beauty when you see it."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't I?" Tim twirled an imaginary
moustache. "I recognise it every time I look
in the glass! Well, how are you aside from the
bum fist?"</p>

<p>"Great! I've just had a s&eacute;ance with Josh. I
tried to register and sneak by, but Brooke
wouldn't have it that way. 'Er, quite so, Gilbert,
quite so, but I&mdash;er&mdash;think you had better
see Mr. Fernald.' So I did, and Josh read me
the riot act. Thought for awhile he was going
to send me home again."</p>

<p>"But didn't you tell him your train was
wrecked?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he didn't believe in it much.
Thought I was romancing, I guess. Got a railway
guide and showed me how I might have got
here on time just the same. Maybe he's right,
but I couldn't figure it out in Cincinnati. Besides,
I didn't get away with much of anything
besides pajamas and overcoat and shoes, and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
I had to refit. That lost me the first connection
and then I got held up again at Pittsburg. So
here I am, the late Mr. Gilbert."</p>

<p>"Josh is an idiot," said Tim disgustedly.
"Didn't he see your hand? How did he think you
did that if you weren't in a wreck?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I kept that in my pocket and I guess he
didn't notice it. He came around all right in the
end, though. We parted friends. At least, I did."</p>

<p>"Well, what about that?" Tim nodded at the
injured hand. "How'd you cut you, burn you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Things got on fire."</p>

<p>"You're the most vivid descriptionist I ever
listened to! Come across with the sickening details.
How did it happen? I didn't see anything
about it in the papers."</p>

<p>"Probably wasn't on the sporting page," replied
Don gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, dry up and blow away! Wasn't it in the
papers?"</p>

<p>"Cincinnati papers had it. I haven't read the
others. It wasn't much of a wreck really. Engineer
killed, fireman scalded, about twenty passengers
injured more or less. Several considerably
more. Express messenger expected to pass out.
Just a nice, cosy little wreck with no&mdash;no spectacular
features, as you might say."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, come on! How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"Freight train taking a siding and went to sleep
at it. Our engine bumped the other engine and
they both went smash. Hot coals and steam and
so on got busy. It was about five in the morning.
Just getting lightish. Everyone snuggled up in
bed. <i>Biff! Wow!</i> I landed out on the floor on my
hands and knees. Everyone yelled. Car turned
half over and sat that way. Doors got jammed.
We beat it out by the windows. I was a Roman
Senator with a green berth curtain wrapped about
me. Afterwards I sneaked back and pulled out my
shoes and overcoat. Always sleep with my shoes
under my pillow, you see. Good idea, too. If I
hadn't had them there I'd never have got them.
Couldn't get my bag out. Car was on fire by that
time. Three others, too. They saved all but the
one I was in and the express and baggage cars.
After awhile a wrecking train came and then a lot
of us walked to a village about a mile and a half
away and had breakfast and went on to Cincinnati
about noon."</p>

<p>"Gee! But, still, you know, I don't see how you
got burned."</p>

<p>"Well, things were pretty hot. Some of them
got burned a lot worse than I did. Had to pull
some of them out the windows and through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
roofs. Women, too. Lucky thing our car had only
two in it. Two women, I mean. Things were
fairly busy for awhile."</p>

<p>"Must have been. The engineer was killed
straight off, eh?"</p>

<p>"Ours was. The other one managed to jump.
Firemen got off all right, too. The other fireman.
Ours got caught and scalded like the dickens. Saw
the engineer myself." Don frowned and shuddered.
"Nasty mess he was, too, poor fellow.
Let's talk about something else. I don't like to
remember that engineer."</p>

<p>"Too bad! But, say, you were lucky, weren't
you? You might have been killed, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Might have, maybe. Didn't come very near it,
though. First wreck I ever saw and don't want
to see any more. Funny thing, though, I didn't
mind it at all until I was on the train going to
Cincinnati. Excitement, I suppose. Then I came
near keeling over, honest! What do you know
about that, Timmy?"</p>

<p>"I guess anyone would have. How bad is your
burn?"</p>

<p>"Not bad. Hurts a bit, though. It's the inside
of the fingers and the palm. It'll be all right in a
few days, I guess. Doctor chap said I'd have to
have it dressed every day for awhile."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Great Scott, Don, what about football?"</p>

<p>"I've thought of that. Nothing doing for a
week or so, I guess. Rotten luck, eh?"</p>

<p>"Beastly! And Robey was telling me only half
an hour ago to hurry you up. Said you'd have to
come right out if you wanted a place. Still, when
he understands what the trouble is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll see him tonight, I guess. Who's playing
guard, Tim?"</p>

<p>"Joe Gafferty, left; Tom Hall, right. Walton
and Pryme and Lawton are all after places. Walton's
been doing good work too, I think."</p>

<p>"All the fellows back?"</p>

<p>"Every last one. Remember Howard, who
played sub half-back for the second last year?
He's showing great form. Still, you can't tell
much yet. There's to be scrimmage tomorrow.
We play Thacher Saturday, you know. Sort of
quick work and I don't believe we'll be anywhere
near ready for them."</p>

<p>"Thacher's easy. We beat them 26 to 3 last
year."</p>

<p>"Twenty-three to three."</p>

<p>"Twenty-six."</p>

<p>"Twenty-three. Bet you!"</p>

<p>"I don't bet, Timmy. Know I'm right, though.
Anyway, Thacher's easy. Tell me the news."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, there isn't anything startling. We had
the usual polite party at Josh's last night. Shook
hands with the new chaps and told 'em how tickled
we were to see them. Ate sandwiches and cake
and lemonade and&mdash;by the way, we've got a new
master; physics; Moller his name is; Caleb Moller,
B.A. Quite a handsome brute and a swell dresser.
Comes from Lehigh or one of those Southern colleges,
I believe."</p>

<p>"Lehigh's in Pennsylvania, you ignoramus."</p>

<p>"Is it?" answered Tim untroubledly. "All
right. Let it stay there. Anyhow, Caleb is some
cheese."</p>

<p>"Where's Rollinson gone?"</p>

<p>"Don't know what happened to Rollo. Draper
said he heard he'd gone to some whopping
big prep school up in New Hampshire or somewhere."</p>

<p>"Or some other Southern school," suggested
Don soberly.</p>

<p>"Dry up! And, say, get a move on. It's nearly
time for eats and I'm starved."</p>

<p>"Timmy, I never saw the time you weren't
starved. All right. I'm sort of hungry myself.
Haven't had anything since about ten o'clock this
morning. Ran out of money. Got here with eight
cents in my pocket. That and my tuition check.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
I'd have cashed that if I could have and had a
dinner. I was sure hungry!"</p>

<p>"Well, wash your dirty face and hands," said
Tim, "and come along. Oh, say, Don, wait till you
see the classy Norfolk suit I've got. I enticed
dad into Crook's when we struck the city; told him
I had to have some hankies and ties, you know.
Then I steered him up against this here suit, and
this here suit made a hit with him right away.
If he could have got into it himself he'd have
walked out in it. It's sort of green with a reddish
thread wandering carelessly through it. It's some
apparel, take it from me."</p>

<p>"Maybe I will if it fits me," responded Don.</p>

<p>"Will what?"</p>

<p>"Take it from you."</p>

<p>"Gee, but you're bright! Getting wrecked's put
an edge on you, sonny. I'm afraid that suit
wouldn't fit you, though, Don. You've grown
about an inch since Spring, haven't you? You're
beastly fat, too."</p>

<p>"I am not," denied Don, good-humouredly indignant.
"I've kept in strict training all summer.
What you think is fat is good hard muscle, Timmy.
Feel of that arm if you don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Yes, quite village-blacksmithy."</p>

<p>"Quite <i>what?</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Village-blacksmithy. 'The muscles of his
mighty arms were strong as iron bands,' or something
like that. Get out of the way and let me
wash up."</p>

<p>Don retired to his dresser and passed the
brushes over his brown hair and snugged his tie
up a bit. The face that looked back at him from
the mirror was not, perhaps, handsome, although
it by no means merited Tim's aspersions. There
was a nice pair of dark brown eyes, rather slumberous
looking, a nose a trifle too short for perfection
and a mouth a shade too wide. But it was
a good-tempered, pleasant face, on the whole, intelligent
and capable and matching well the physically
capable body below, a body of wide shoulders
and well-knit muscles and a deep chest that might
have belonged to a youth of eighteen instead of
seventeen. Compared with Tim Otis, who was of
the same age, Don Gilbert suffered on only two
counts&mdash;quickness and vivacity. Tim, well-muscled,
possessed a litheness that Don could never
attain to, and moved, thought and spoke far more
quickly. In height Don topped his friend by
almost a full inch and was broader and bigger-boned.
They were both, in spite of dissimilarity,
fine, manly fellows.</p>

<p>Tim, wiping his hands after ablutions, turned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
survey Don with a quizzical smile on his good-looking
face. And, after a moment's reflective regard
of his chum's broad back, he broke the
silence.</p>

<p>"Say, Don," he asked, "glad to get back?"</p>

<p>Don turned, while a slow smile crept over his
countenance.</p>

<p>"<i>Su-u-re</i>," he drawled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>AMY HOLDS FORTH</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Brimfield Academy</span> is at Brimfield, and Brimfield
is a scant thirty miles out of New York City
and some two or three miles from the Sound. It is
more than possible that these facts are already
known to you; if you live in the vicinity of New
York they certainly are. But at the risk of being
tiresome I must explain a little about the school
for the benefit of those readers who are unacquainted
with it. Brimfield was this Fall entering
on its twenty-fifth year, a fact destined to be
appropriately celebrated later on. The enrollment
was one hundred and eighty students and
the faculty consisted of twenty members inclusive
of the principal, Mr. Joshua L. Fernald, A.M.,
more familiarly known as "Josh." The course
covers six years, and boys may enter the First
Form at the age of twelve. Being an endowed
institution and well supplied with money under
the terms of the will of its founder, Brimfield
boasts of its fine buildings. There are four dormitories,
Wendell, Torrence, Hensey and Billings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
all modern, and, between Torrence and Hensey,
the original Academy Building now known as
Main Hall and containing the class rooms, school
offices, assembly room and library. The dining
hall is in Wendell, the last building on the right.
Behind Wendell is the gymnasium. Occupying
almost if not quite as retiring a situation at the
other end of the Row, is the Cottage, Mr. Fernald's
residence. Each dormitory is ruled over
by a master. In Billings Mr. Daley, the instructor
in modern languages, was in charge at
the period of this story, and since it was necessary
to receive permission before leaving the school
grounds after supper, Don and Tim paused at Mr.
Daley's study on the way out. Don's knock on
the portal of Number 8 elicited an instant invitation
to enter and a moment later he was shaking
hands with the hall master, a youngish man with
a pleasant countenance and a manner at once
eager and embarrassed. Mr. Daley was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'usully'">usually</ins>
referred to as Horace, which was his first name,
and, as he shook hands, Don very nearly committed
the awful mistake of calling him that! After
greetings had been exchanged Don explained
somewhat vaguely the reason for his tardy arrival
and then requested permission to visit
Coach Robey in the village after supper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></div>

<p>"Yes, Gilbert, but&mdash;er&mdash;be back by eight, please.
I'm not sure that Mr. Robey isn't about school,
however. Have you inquired?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, but Tim says he isn't eating in hall
yet, and so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, in that case perhaps not. Well, be back
for study hour. If you're going to supper I'll
walk along with you, fellows." Mr. Daley closed
his study door and they went out together and,
as they trod the flags of the long walk that passed
the fronts of the buildings, Mr. Daley discoursed
on football with Tim while Don replied to the
greetings of friends. They parted from the instructor
at the dining hall door and sought their
places at table, Don's arrival being greeted with
acclaim by the other half-dozen occupants of the
board. Once more he was obliged to give an account
of himself, but this time his narrative was
considered to be sadly lacking in detail and it was
not until Tim had come to his assistance with a
highly coloured if not exactly authentic history of
the train-wreck that the audience was satisfied.
Don told him he was an idiot. Tim, declining to
argue the point, revenged himself by stealing a
slice of Don's bread when the latter's attention
was challenged by Harry Westcott at the farther
end of the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Westcott, who was one of the editors of the
school monthly, <i>The Review</i>, had developed the
journalistic instinct to a high degree of late and had
visions of a thrilling story in the November issue.
But Don utterly refused to pose as a hero of any
sort. The best Harry could get out of him was
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'acknowledgement'">acknowledgment</ins> that he had seen several
persons removed from the wreck and had helped
carry one to the relief train later. That wasn't
much to go on, and, subsequently, Harry regretfully
abandoned his plan.</p>

<p>After supper Don and Tim walked down to the
village and Don had a few minutes of talk with
the coach. Mr. Robey was sympathetic but annoyed.
Although he didn't say so in so many
words he gave Don to understand that he had
failed in his duty to the school and the team in
allowing himself to become concerned in a train-wreck.
He didn't explain just how Don could
have avoided it, and Don didn't think it worth
while to inquire.</p>

<p>"You have that hand looked after properly and
regularly, Gilbert," he said, "and watch practice
until you can put on togs. Losing a week or
so is going to handicap you. No doubt about that.
And I'm not making any promises. But you keep
your eyes open and maybe there'll be a place for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
you when you're ready to work. It's awfully hard
luck, old chap. See you tomorrow."</p>

<p>Don went back to school through the warm dusk
slightly cast down, although he had previously
realised that football would be beyond him for at
least a week. It is sometimes one thing to acknowledge
a fact oneself and another to hear the
same fact stated by a second person. There's a
certain finality about the latter that is convincing.
But if Don was downcast he didn't show it to his
companion. Don had a way of concealing his emotions
that Tim at once admired and resented.
When Tim felt blue&mdash;which was mighty seldom&mdash;he
let it be known to the whole world, and when he
felt gay he was just as confiding. But Don&mdash;well,
as Tim often said, he was "worse than an
Indian!"</p>

<p>After study they sallied forth again, arm in arm,
and went down the Row to Torrence and climbed
the stairs to Number 14. As the door was half
open knocking was a needless formality&mdash;especially
as the noise within would have prevented its
being heard&mdash;and so Tim pushed the portal further
ajar and entered, followed by Don, on a most
animated scene. Eight boys were sprawled or
seated around the room, while another, a thin, tall,
unkempt youth with a shock of very black hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which was always falling over his eyes and being
brushed aside, was standing in a small clearing
between table and windows balancing a baseball
bat, surmounted by two books and a glass of water,
on his chin. So interested was the audience in
this startling feat that the presence of the new
arrivals passed unnoted until the juggler, suddenly
stepping back, allowed the law of gravity
to have its way for an instant. Then his right
hand caught the falling bat, the two books crashed
unheeded to the floor and his left hand seized the
descending tumbler. Simultaneously there was a
disgruntled yelp from Jim Morton and a howl of
laughter from the rest of the audience. For the
juggler, while he had miraculously caught the
tumbler in mid-air, had not been deft enough to
keep the contents intact and about half of it had
gone into the football manager's face. However,
everyone there except Morton applauded enthusiastically
and hilariously, and Larry Jones,
sweeping his offending locks aside with the careless
and impatient grace of a violin virtuoso,
bowed repeatedly.</p>

<p>"Great stuff," approved Amory Byrd, rescuing
his books from the floor. "Do it again and
stand nearer Jim."</p>

<p>"If he does it again I'm going into the hall,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
said Morton disgustedly, wiping his damp countenance
on the edge of Clint Thayer's bedspread.
"You're a punk juggler, Larry."</p>

<p>"All right, you do it," was the reply. Larry
proffered the bat and tumbler, but Morton waved
them indignantly aside.</p>

<p>"I don't do monkey-tricks, thanks. Gee, my collar's
sopping wet!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," called someone. "You'll
be going to bed soon. Say, Larry, do that one with
the three tennis balls."</p>

<p>"Isn't room enough. I know a good trick with
coins, though. Any fellow got two halves?"</p>

<p>Groans of derision were heard and at that moment
someone discovered the presence of Don and
Tim and Larry's audience deserted him. When
the new-comers had found accommodations, such
as they were, conversation switched to the all-absorbing
subject of football. Most of the fellows
assembled were members of the first or second
teams: Larry Jones was a substitute half; Clint
Thayer was first-choice left tackle; Steve Edwards,
sprawled on Clint's bed, was left end and
this year's captain; the short, sturdy youth in the
Morris chair was Thursby, the centre; Tom Hall,
broad of shoulders, was right guard; Harry Walton,
slimmer and rangier, with a rather saturnine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
countenance, was a substitute for that position.
Jim Morton was, as we know, manager, and only
Amory&mdash;or "Amy"&mdash;Byrd and Leroy Draper, the
tow-headed, tip-nosed youth sharing the Morris
chair with Thursby, were, in a manner of speaking,
non-combatants.</p>

<p>But being a non-combatant didn't prevent Amy
Byrd from airing his views and opinions on the
subject of football, and that he was now doing.
"Every year," he protested, "I have to hear the
same line of talk from you chaps. It's wearying,
woesomely wearying. Now, as a matter of fact,
every one of you knows that we've got the average
material and that we'll go ahead and turn out an
average team and beat Claflin as per usual. The
only chance for argument is what the score will be.
You fellows like to grouse and pretend every fall
that the team's shot full of holes and that the
world is a dark, dreary, dismal place and that winning
from Claflin is only a hectic dream. For the
love of lemons, fellows, chuck the undertaker stuff
and cheer up. Talk about something interesting,
or, if you must talk your everlasting football, cut
out the sobs!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dry up, Amy," said Tom Hall. "You
oughtn't to be allowed to talk. Someone stuff a
pillow in his mouth. No one has said we were shot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
full of holes, but you can't get around the fact that
we've lost a lot of good players and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, gee, he's at it again!" wailed Amy. "Yes,
Thomas darling, you've lost two fellows out of the
line and two out of the backfield and there's nothing
to live for and we'd better poison ourselves off
before defeat and disgrace come upon us. All is
lost save honour! Ah, woe is me!"</p>

<p>"Cut it out, Amy," begged Edwards. "You
don't know anything about football, you idiot."</p>

<p>"Two in the line and two in the backfield is
good," jeered Tim. "We've lost Blaisdell and
Innes and Tyler&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never was any good," interpolated Amy.</p>

<p>"And Roberts and Marvin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Carmine's better!"</p>

<p>"And Kendall and Harris!" concluded Tim triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Timmy, you've still got me!" replied
Amy sweetly. "Gee, to hear you rave you'd
think the whole team had graduated!"</p>

<p>"So it has, practically!"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, and I heard the same dope this time
last year. We'd lost Miller and Sawyer and Williams
and&mdash;and Milton and a dozen or two more
and there wasn't any hope for us! And all we
did was to go ahead and dodder along and beat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Claflin seven to nothing! Not so bad for a lifeless
corpse, what?"</p>

<p>Steve Edwards laughed. "Well, maybe we do
talk trouble a good deal about this time of year.
It's natural, I guess. You lose fellows who played
fine ball last year and you can't see just at first
how anyone can fill their places. Someone always
does, though. That's the bully part of it. I dare
say we'll manage to dodder along, as Amy calls
it, and rub it into old Claflin as we've been doing."</p>

<p>"First sensible word I've heard tonight," said
Amy approvingly. "I wouldn't kick so much if I
only had to hear this sort of stuff occasionally, but
I'm rooming with the original cr&ecirc;pe-hanger!
Clint sobs himself to sleep at night thinking how
terribly the dear old team's shot to pieces. If I
remark in my optimistic, gladsome way, 'Clint,
list how sweetly the birdies sing, and observe, I
prithee, the sunlight gilding yon mountain peak,'
Clint turns his mournful countenance on me and
chokes out something about a weak backfield!
Say, I'm gladder every day of my life that I
stayed sane and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stayed <i>what?</i>" exclaimed Jim Morton incredulously.</p>

<p>"And didn't become obsessed with football
mania!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where do you get the words, Amy?" sighed
Clint Thayer admiringly.</p>

<p>"Amy's the original phonograph," commented
Tim. "Only he's an improvement on anything
Edison ever invented. You don't have to wind
Amy up!"</p>

<p>"No, he's got a self-starting attachment,"
chuckled Draper.</p>

<p>"Returning to the&mdash;the original contention,"
continued Amy in superb disdain of the low jests,
"I'll bet any one of you or the whole kit and
caboodle of you that we beat Claflin again this
year. Now make a noise like some money!"</p>

<p>"Amy, we don't bet," remarked Tom Hall.
"At least, not with money. Betting money is very
wrong. (Amy sniffed sarcastically.) But I'll
wager a good feed for the crowd that we have a
harder time beating Claflin this year than we had
last. And I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, piffle! I don't care whether you have to
work harder to do it or not. I say you'll do it!
Hard work wouldn't hurt you, anyway. You're a
lot of loafers. All any of you do is go out to the
field and strike an attitude like a hero. Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cries of expostulation and threats of physical
violence failed to disturb the irrepressible
Amy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell you what I'll do, you piffling Greeks, I'll
blow you all off to a top-hole dinner at the Inn if
Claflin beats us. There's a sporting proposition
for you, you undertakers' assistants!"</p>

<p>"Yah! What do we do if she doesn't?" exclaimed
Walton.</p>

<p>Amy surveyed him coldly. He didn't like
Harry Walton and never attempted to disguise
the fact. "Why, Harry, old dear, you'll just keep
right on squandering your money as usual, I suppose.
But I don't want you to waste any on me.
This is a one-man wager."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," said Leroy Draper, "I'm in on
it, Amy. I'll take half of it."</p>

<p>"All right, Roy. But our money's safe as safe!
This bunch of grousers won't get fat off us, old
chap!"</p>

<p>"Say," said Walton, who had been trying to get
Amy's attention for a minute, "what's the story
about my squandering my money? Anybody seen
you being careless with yours, Amy?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of. I'm not careless with it;
I'm careful. But being careful with money is different
from having it glued to your skin so you
have to have a surgical operation before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it, Amy," said Tim.</p>

<p>"I spend my money just as freely as you do,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
returned Walton hotly. "You talk so much with
your face&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let it go at that, Harry," advised Tom Hall
soothingly. "Amy's just talking."</p>

<p>"That's all," agreed Amy sweetly. "Just talking.
You're the original little spendthrift, Harry.
I'm going to write home to your folks some time
and warn 'em. Hold on, you chaps, don't hurry
off. The night is still in its infancy. Wait and
watch it grow up. Steve! <i>Sit down!</i>"</p>

<p>"Thanks, I've got to be moseying along," replied
Captain Edwards. "It's pretty near ten. I
think it would be a rather good idea if we had a
rule that football men were to be in their rooms
at a quarter to ten all during the season."</p>

<p>"I can see that you're going to be one of these
here martinets you read about," said Tim with
a sigh. "Steve, remember you were young once
yourself."</p>

<p>"He never was!" declared Amy with decision.
"Steve was grown-up when he was quite young
and he's never got over it. Thank the Fates <i>I</i>
don't have to be bossed by him! Are you all leaving?
Clint, count the spoons and forks! Come
again, everyone. I've got lots more to say. Good-night,
Don. Glad to see you back again, old sober-sides.
Sorry about that fin of yours. Be careful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
with him, Tim. You know how it is with the dear
old team. We need every man we can get. Hold
on, Harry! Did you drop that quarter? Oh, I
beg pardon, it's only a button. That's right,
Thurs, kick the chair over if it's in your way.
We don't care a bit about our furniture. For the
love of lemons, Larry, don't grin like that! Think
of the team, man! Remember your sorrows!
Good-<i>night!</i>"</p>

<p>Half-way to Billings Don broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Fellows are funny, aren't they?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Funny? How do you mean?" asked Tim.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied Don after a
thoughtful moment. "They're&mdash;they're so different,
I guess."</p>

<p>"Who's different from who?"</p>

<p>"Everyone," answered Don, smothering a
yawn.</p>

<p>Tim viewed him in the radiance of the light
over the doorway with profound admiration.
"Don, you're a brilliant chap! Honest, sometimes
I wonder how you do it! Doesn't it hurt?"</p>

<p>Don only smiled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST GAME</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Don</span> sat on the bench and watched the game
with Thacher School. With him were nearly a
dozen other substitutes, but they, unlike Don,
were in football togs and might, in fact probably
would, get into the game sooner or later. There
was no such luck for Don so long as his hand remained
swathed in bandages, and he was silently
bewailing his luck. At his right sat Danny Moore,
chin in hand and elbow in palm, viewing the contest
from half-closed eyes. The trainer was small
and red of hair and very freckled, and he was
thoroughly Irish and, in the manner of his race,
mightily proud of it. Also, he was a clever little
man and a good trainer.</div>

<p>An attempted forward pass by the visitors
grounded and the horn squawked the end of the
first period. Danny turned his beady green eyes
on Don. "Likely you're wishin' yourself out there
with the rest of 'em, boy," he said questioningly.</p>

<p>Don nodded, smiled his slow smile and shook
his head. "I guess I won't get into it for a week<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
yet. Doc says this hand has got to do a lot of
healing first. He has a fine time every day pulling
and cutting the old skin off it. Guess he enjoys
it so much he will hate to have it heal. I should
think, Danny, that if I had a heavy glove, sort of
padded in the palm, I might play a little."</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll fix you up something real nate,"
replied Danny readily. "Nate an' scientific, d'ye
see? An' so soon as the Doc says the word
you come to me an' I'll be having it ready for
you."</p>

<p>"Will you? Thanks, Danny. That's great! I
would like to get back to practice again. I'm
afraid I'll be as stiff and stale as anything if I
stay out much longer."</p>

<p>"Go easy on your eating, lad, and it'll take you
no time at all to catch up with the rest of 'em.
Spread this hand for me while I see the shape of
it. What happened to your finger there?"</p>

<p>"I broke it when I was a little kid, playing
baseball."</p>

<p>"Sure, whoever set it for you must have been
cross-eyed," said the trainer, drily. "'Tis a bum
job he did."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a little crooked, but it works all
right."</p>

<p>"You'd have hard work gettin' your engagement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
ring over that lump, I'm thinking. It's a fortunate
thing you're not a girl, d'ye mind."</p>

<p>Don laughed. "Engagement rings go on the
other hand, don't they, Danny?"</p>

<p>"Faith, I don't know. Bad luck to him, he's
done it again!"</p>

<p>"Who? What?" asked Don startledly.</p>

<p>"Jim Morton. That's twice today he's spilled
most of the water from the pail. Well, I'll have
to go an' fill it, I suppose."</p>

<p>Danny went off to get the water bucket and the
teams lined up again near the visitors' twenty-five
yard line. Coach Robey had put in a somewhat
patched-up team today. Captain Edwards was
at left end, Clint Thayer at left tackle, Gafferty at
left guard, Peters at centre, Pryme at right guard,
Crewe at right tackle, Lee at right end, Carmine
at quarter, St. Clair and Gordon at half and Martin
at full. It was not the best line-up possible,
but it was so far handling the situation fairly satisfactorily.
The practice of the last two days had
developed one or two strains and proved more
than one of the first-choice fellows far below condition.
Tim Otis was out for a day or two with
a twisted knee and Tom Hall with a lame shoulder.
Thursby had developed an erratic streak the
day before and was nursing his chagrin further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
along the bench. Holt, the best right end, was in
trouble with the faculty, and Rollins, full-back, had
pulled a tendon in his ankle. A full team of second- and
third-string players were having signal
work on the practice gridiron.</p>

<p>In the stands a fairly good-sized gathering of
onlookers was applauding listlessly at such infrequent
times as the maroon-and-grey team gave it
any excuse. Thus far, however, exciting episodes
had been scarce. The weather, which was enervatingly
warm, affected both elevens and the playing
was sluggish and far from brilliant. The
Brimfield backs, with the exception of Carmine,
who was always on edge, conducted themselves as
if they were at a rehearsal, accepting the ball in
an indifferent manner and half-heartedly plunging
at the opposing line or jogging around the
ends. As the first half drew to a close both goal
lines were still unthreatened and from all indications
would remain so for the rest of the contest.
A slight thrill was developed, though, just before
the second period came to an end when a Thacher
half-back managed to get away outside Crewe and
romped half the length of the field before he was
laid low by Carmine. After that there was an exchange
of punts and the teams trotted off to the
gymnasium.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Don left the bench with the others, but did not
follow them to the dressing room. Instead, he
strolled down the running track and across to the
practice field, where Tim was superintending the
signal practice. Don joined him and followed the
panting, perspiring players down the field. Tim's
conversation was rather difficult to follow, since he
continually interrupted himself to instruct or admonish
the toilers.</p>

<p>"I feel like a slave-driver, pushing these poor
chaps around in this heat. How's the game going?
No score? We must be playing pretty punk, I
guess. What sort of a team has&mdash;Jones, you
missed your starting signal again. For the love
of mud, keep your ears open!&mdash;Thacher must be
as bad as we are. Who's playing in my place?
Gordon? Is he doing anything?&mdash;Try them on
that again, McPhee, will you? Robbins, you're
supposed to block hard on that and not let your
man through until the runner's got into the line.&mdash;I
could have played today all right, but that idiot,
Danny, wouldn't let me. My knee's perfectly all
right."</p>

<p>"Then why do you limp?" asked Don innocently.</p>

<p>"Force of habit," said Tim. "What time is
it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Don consulted his silver watch and announced
a quarter to four.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness! That'll do, fellows. You'd
better get your showers before you try to see that
game. If Danny catches you over there the way
you are he will just about scalp you! By the way,
McPhee, you saw what I meant about that end-around
play, didn't you? You can't afford to
slow up the play by waiting for your end to get
to you. He's got to be in position to take the
pass at the right second. Otherwise they'll come
through on you and stop him behind the line.
There ought to be absolutely no pause between
Smith's pass to you and your pass to Compton,
or whoever the end is. You get the ball, turn
quick, toss it to the end and fall in behind him.
It ought to be almost one motion. Of course, I
know you fellows were pretty well fagged today,
but you don't want to let your ends think they can
take their time on that play, old man, for it's got
to be fast or it's no earthly good. Thus endeth
the lesson. Come on, Don, and we'll go over and
add the dignity of our presence to that little
affair."</p>

<p>They reached the bench just as the two teams
trotted back and Brimfield's supporters raised a
faint cheer. Don imagined that there was a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
more vim in the way the maroon-and-grey warriors
went into the field for the second half and
the results proved him right.</p>

<p>It was the home team's kick-off, and after Captain
Edwards, in the absence of Hall, had sped the
ball down to Thacher's twenty yards and a
Thacher player had sped it back to the thirty,
Brimfield settled down to business. Probably Coach
Robey's remarks in the interim had been sufficiently
caustic to get under the skin. At all events
Brimfield forced Thacher to punt on third down
and then almost blocked the kick. As it was, the
ball hurtled out of bounds near the middle of the
field and became Brimfield's on her forty-eight.
Two plunges netted five yards, and then St. Clair,
returning to form, ripped his way past tackle on
the left and fought over two white lines before
he was halted. Gordon and Martin made it first
down in three tries and Carmine worked the left
end for four more. Thacher stiffened then, however,
and after two ineffectual plunges St. Clair
punted and Brimfield caught on her goal line and
ran back a dozen yards, Lee, right end, missing
his tackle badly and Steve Edwards being neatly
blocked off. But Thacher found the going even
harder than her opponent had and in a moment
she, too, was forced to punt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>This time it was St. Clair who caught and who,
eluding both Thacher ends, ran straight along the
side line until he was upset near the enemy's
thirty-five yards. As he went down he managed
to get one foot over the line and the referee
paced in fifteen yards, set the ball to earth and
waved toward the Thacher goal.</p>

<p>Martin faked a forward pass and the ball went
to Gordon for a try at right tackle. Thayer and
Gafferty opened a fine hole there and Gordon
romped through and made eight before the
Thacher secondary defence brought him down.
Martin completed the distance through centre.
From the twenty-four yards to the ten the ball
went, progress, however, becoming slower as the
attack neared the goal. On a shift that brought
Thayer to the right side of the line, St. Clair got
around the short end for three and Martin added
two more, leaving the pigskin on the five-yard line.
It was third down and Martin went back to kick.
But after a moment's hesitation Carmine changed
his signals and the ends stole out toward the side
lines. Thacher proceeded to arrange her forces
to intercept a forward pass and again Carmine
switched. The ends crept back and Martin retired
to the fifteen-yard line and patted the turf.
Carmine knelt in front of him and eyed the goal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Then the signals came again, and with them the
ball, and it was Martin who caught it and not Carmine.
Two steps to the right, a quick heave, a
frenzied shouting from the defenders of the goal,
a confused jostling, and Captain Edwards, one
foot over the line, reached his arms into the air,
pulled down the hurtling pigskin, tore away from
one of the enemy, lunged forward and went down
under a mass of bodies, but well over the goal line.</p>

<p>Brimfield found her enthusiasm then, and her
voice, and cheered loudly and long, only ceasing
when Carmine walked out with the ball under his
arm and flung himself to the turf opposite the
right hand goal post. Thursby, hustled in by Coach
Robey, measured distance and direction, stepped
forward and, as the line of Thacher warriors
swept forward with upstretched hands, swung
his toe against the ball and sent it neatly across
the bar.</p>

<p>With the score seven to nothing against her,
Thacher returned to the fray with a fine determination,
but, when the teams had changed places
after the kick-off and the last period had begun, she
speedily found that victory was not to be her portion.
Mr. Robey sent in nearly a new team during
that last ten minutes and the substitutes, fresh
and eager, went at it hammer-and-tongs. Thacher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
enlisted fresh material, too, but it couldn't stop
the onslaught that soon took the ball down the
field to within close scoring distance of her goal.
That Brimfield did not add another touchdown was
only because her line, overanxious, was twice
found off-side and penalised. Even then the ball
went at last to within six inches of the goal line
and it was only after the nimble referee had dug
into the pile-up like a terrier scratching for a bone
in an ash-heap that the fact was determined that
Thacher had saved her bacon by the width of the
ball. She kicked out of danger from behind her
goal and after two plays the final whistle blew.</p>

<p>It was a very hot and very weary crowd of fellows
who thronged the dressing room in the gymnasium
five minutes later and, above the swish of
water in the showers, shouted back and forth and
discussed the game from as many angles as there
had been participants. Possibly Brimfield had
no very good reason for feeling proud of her
afternoon's work, for last year she had defeated
Thacher 26 to 3. That game, however, had taken
place two weeks later in the season, when the
Maroon-and-Grey was better off in the matter of
experience, and so perhaps was not a fair comparison.
At all events, Brimfield liked the way
she had "come back" in that third period and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
liked the way in which the substitutes had behaved,
and displayed a very evident inclination to
pat herself on the back.</p>

<p>Tim, who had haled Don into the gymnasium
on the way back to hall, tried his best to convince
all those who would listen to him that they had
played a perfectly punk game and that nothing
but the veriest fluke had accounted for that score.
But they called him a "sore-head" and laughed
at him, and even drove him away with flicking
towels, and he finally gave it up and consented to
accompany Don back to Billings, limping a trifle
whenever he thought no one was looking.</p>

<p>Don missed Tim at supper, for the training
tables started that evening and Tim went off to
one of them with his napkin ring and his own particular
bottle of tomato catsup, leaving his chum
feeling forlornly "out of it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>DON GOES TO THE SECOND</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Life</span> at Brimfield Academy settled down for Don
into the accustomed routine. The loss of one day
made no difference in the matter of lessons, for
with Tim's assistance&mdash;they were both in the Fifth
Form&mdash;he easily made up what had been missed.
They were taking up German that year for the
first time and Don found it hard going, but he managed
to satisfy Mr. Daley after a fashion. Don
was a fellow who studied hard because he had to.
Tim could skim his lessons, make a good showing
in class and remember enough of what he had gone
over to appear quite erudite. Don had to get right
down and grapple with things. He once said enviously,
and with as near an approach to an
epigram as he was capable of, that whereas Tim
got his lessons by inhaling them, he, Don, had to
chew them up and swallow them! But when examination
time came Don's method of assimilation
showed better results.</div>

<p>The injured hand healed with incredible slowness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
but heal it did, and at last the day came when
the doctor consented to let his impatient pupil put
on the padded arrangement that the ingenious
Danny Moore had fashioned of a discarded
fielder's glove and some curled hair, and Don triumphantly
reported for practice. His triumph
was, however, short-lived, for Coach Robey viewed
him dubiously and relegated him to the second
squad, from which Mr. Boutelle was then forming
his second team. "Boots" was a graduate
who turned up every Fall and took charge of the
second or scrub team. It was an open secret that
he received no remuneration. Patriotism and
sheer love of the game were the inducements that
caused Mr. Boutelle to donate some two months
of time and labour to the cause of turning out a
second team strong enough to give the first the
practice it needed. And he always succeeded.
"Boutelle's Babies," as someone had facetiously
termed them, could invariably be depended on to
give the school eleven as hard a tussle as it wanted&mdash;and
sometimes a deal harder. Boots was a bit
of a driver and believed in strenuous work, but his
charges liked him immensely and performed miracles
of labour at his command. His greeting of
Don was almost as dubious as had been Coach
Robey's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I'm glad to have you, Gilbert, but
the trouble is that as soon as we've got you nicely
working Mr. Robey will take you away. That's a
great trick of his. He seems to think the purpose
of the second team is to train players for the first.
It isn't, though. He gives me what he doesn't
want every year and I do my best to make a team
from it, and I ought to be allowed to keep what I
make. Well, never mind. You do the best you can
while you're with us, Gilbert."</p>

<p>"Maybe he won't have me this year,"
said Don dejectedly. "He seems to think that
being out for a couple of weeks has queered
me."</p>

<p>"Well, you don't feel that way about it, do
you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I'm perfectly all right. I've watched
practice every afternoon and I've been doing a
quarter to a half on the track."</p>

<p>"Hm. Well, you've got a little flesh that will
have to come off, but it won't take long to lose it
this weather. Sit down a minute." They were
in front of the stand and Mr. Boutelle seated himself
on the lower tier and Don followed his example.
"Let me see, Gilbert. Last year you
played left guard, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"And if I remember aright your chief difficulty
was in the matter of weight."</p>

<p>"I'm twelve pounds heavier this fall, air."</p>

<p>"Yes, but some of that'll come off, I guess.
However, that doesn't matter. You were getting
along pretty well at the last of the season,
I remember. Who's ahead of you on the
first?"</p>

<p>"Well, Gafferty's got the first choice, I guess.
And then there's Harry Walton."</p>

<p>"You can beat Walton," said Boots decisively.
"Walton lacks head. He can't think things out for
himself. You can. What you'll have to do this
year, my boy, is speed up a little. It took you
until about the middle of the season to find your
pace. Remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I know."</p>

<p>"Well, you won't stay with us long, as I've said,
and so I'm not going to build you into the line,
Gilbert. I've got some good-looking guard material
and I can't afford to work over you and get
dependent on you and then have Robey snatch you
away about the middle of the fall. That won't do.
But I'll tell you what we will do, Gilbert. We'll
use you enough to bring you around in form
slowly. You'll play left guard for awhile every
day. But what I want you to really do is to help<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with the others. You've been at it two years now
and you know how the position ought to be played
and you've got hard common-sense. I'll put the
guard candidates in your hands. See what you
can do with them. There's a couple of likely chaps
in Kirkwell and Merton, and there are two or three
more after positions. You take them in charge,
Gilbert, and show me what you know about coaching.
What do you say?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Boutelle, I&mdash;I don't know that I can
show anyone else what to do. I can play the position
myself after a fashion, but&mdash;well, I guess it's
another thing to teach, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. It is if you go into it with
the idea that it is, but don't do that. Play the
position as it ought to be played, tell the others
why, call them down when they make mistakes,
pat them on the back when they do right. Just
forget that you're trying to teach. If a fellow
came to you and said: 'Gilbert, I want to play
guard but I don't know how, and I wish you'd tell
me how you do it,' why, you wouldn't have any
trouble, would you?"</p>

<p>"N-no, sir, I guess not," replied Don a trifle
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, there you are. Try it, anyway. You'll
get on all right. I'll be right on hand to dig the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
spurs in when your courage fails." Mr. Boutelle
smiled. "We're going to have a dandy second
team this fall, my boy. We've got nothing to
build on, only a lot of green material, and that's
the best part of it. I don't care how inexperienced
the material is if it's willing to learn and has the
usual number of arms and legs and such things
and a few ounces of grey matter in the cranium.
Well, here we go. Nothing today but passing
and punting, I guess. Sure your hand's all
right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, thanks. I don't really need this contrivance;
it's awfully clumsy; but Doc said I'd
better wear it for a few days."</p>

<p>"Best to be on the safe side. I'll have you take
one squad of these chaps, I guess, and I'll give the
other to Lewis. You know the usual stuff, Gilbert.
Rest 'em up now and then; they're soft and
the weather's warm. But work 'em when they're
working. Any fellow who soldiers gets bounced.
All out, second squad!"</p>

<p>There wasn't anything that afternoon but the
sort of drudgery that tries the enthusiasm of the
tyro: passing the ball in circles, falling on it,
catching it on the bound and starting. Don was
surprised to discover how soft he was in spite of
his daily exercise on the cinders. When the hour's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
practice was over he was just about as thankful
as any of the puffing, perspiring youths around
him. Considering it afterward, Don was unable
to view the material with the enthusiasm Mr. Boutelle
had displayed. To him the thirty-odd boys
who had reported for the second team were a hopeless
lot, barring, of course, a few, not more than
four in all, who had had experience last season.
In another week Mr. Robey would make a cut in
the first squad and the second would find itself
augmented by some ten or twelve cast-offs. But
just now the second squad looked to Don to be a
most unlikely lot. When he confided all this to
Tim that evening the latter said:</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, old man. Boots will make a
team out of them. Why, he could make a football
team out of eleven clothing store dummies! Sometimes
I think that Boots ought to be head coach
instead of Robey. I've got nothing against Robey,
either. He's a bit of a 'miracle man' himself, <i>but</i>
for building a team out of nothing Boutelle has
him both shoulders to the mat!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe Boots would want to coach the
first," replied Don.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He's sort of&mdash;well, he kind of
likes to&mdash;Oh, I don't know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very clearly explained, Donald."</p>

<p>"Well, Boots, if he was a soldier, would be the
sort that would want to lead a charge where the
odds were against him. See what I mean?"</p>

<p>"You mean he has a hankering for the forlorn
chance business? Maybe so. That's not a bad
name for the second, is it? The Forlorn Chances!
I guess you've got him dead to rights, though.
Boots is for the under dog every time. I guess
coaching the first and having his pick of the players
wouldn't make any sort of a hit with Boots. It
would be too tame. Boots likes to take three discarded
veterans, two crips and a handful of green
youngsters and whittle them into a bunch that will
make us sweat and toil to score on. And, what's
more, he does it! Bet you anything, Don, this
year's second will be every bit as good as last
year's."</p>

<p>"I won't take it, because I think so myself,"
laughed Don. "I can't see how he's going to do
it, Tim, but something tells me he will!"</p>

<p>"Oh, with you to coach the guards it will be no
trick at all," said Tim, grinning.</p>

<p>Don smiled thinly. "I'll make an awful mess
of it, I guess," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Not you, boy!" and Tim slapped him encouragingly
on the back. "You'll blunder right ahead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to glory, same as you always do. You'll make
hard work of it and all that, but you'll get there.
Don, you're exactly like the porpoise&mdash;no, the tortoise
in the fable. You don't look fast, old man,
but you keep on moving ahead and saying nothing
and when the hares arrive you're curled up on the
finish line fast asleep. Tortoises can't curl up,
though, can they? And, say, what the dickens <i>is</i>
a tortoise, anyway? I always get tortoises and
porpoises mixed."</p>

<p>"A porpoise is a fish," replied Don gravely.
"And a tortoise is a land turtle. But they're both
anthropoids."</p>

<p>"Are they?" asked Tim vaguely. "All right.
Here, what are you grinning at? Anthropoids
nothing! An anthropoid is a monkey or&mdash;or something."</p>

<p>"You're an anthropoid yourself, Timmy."</p>

<p>"Meaning I'm a monkey?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. Here, look it up." And Don
shoved a dictionary across the table. Tim accepted
it suspiciously.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "but if it's what I think
it is you'll have to fight. Anthesis, anthropocosmic&mdash;&mdash;
Say, I'm glad you didn't call me that!
Here it is. Now let's see. 'Anthropoid, somewhat
like a human being in form or other characteristics'!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Something like&mdash;&mdash; You wait till I get you
in the tank again! 'Something like a human
being'! For two cents I'd lay you on the bed and
spank you with that tennis racket!"</p>

<p>"I've got two cents that say you can't do it,"
replied Don.</p>

<p>"Well, I could if there wasn't so much of you,"
grumbled Tim. "Now shut up and let me stuff
awhile. Horace has been eyeing me in a way I
don't like lately. How's your German going?"</p>

<p>"Not very well. It's a silly language, I think.
But I guess I'll get the hang of it after awhile.
What I want to know is why they can't make their
letters the way we do."</p>

<p>"Because they're afraid someone might be able
to read the plaguy stuff. Tell you what we'll do,
Don."</p>

<p>"What'll we do?"</p>

<p>"We'll go for a swim in the tank after study.
Will you?"</p>

<p>Don winked slowly. "Not after that threat,
thanks."</p>

<p>"I won't touch you, honest to goodness, Don!
Did you learn to swim any better this Summer?"</p>

<p>"Where would I learn?" asked the other.
"There's no place to swim out my way, unless it's
the river."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, don't the rivers in Kansas contain
water?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sometimes! Winter, usually. If you'll
promise not to grab me when I'm not looking I'll
go. I hate the taste of that tank water, Tim."</p>

<p>"You ought to know how to swim, old man.
Never mind, Mr. Conklin will get hold of you this
Winter and beat it into you."</p>

<p>"I can swim now," replied Don indignantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can swim like a hunk of lead!
The last time I saw you try it you did five strokes
and then got so elated that you nearly drowned
yourself trying to cheer! I could teach you in
three lessons if you'd let me."</p>

<p>"Much obliged, but nothing doing, Timmy. I'd
as lief drown by myself as have you hold my head
under water."</p>

<p>"That was just a joke, Don. I won't ever do it
again. I wanted you to get used to the water, you
see."</p>

<p>"I don't mind getting used to it outside, but I
hate to fill up with it, Tim. It tastes very nasty.
You may be a good teacher, but I don't like your
methods."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll go and have a dip, anyway,"
laughed Tim. "It'll set us up and refresh us
after our arduous stuffing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you don't cut out the chatter there won't be
any stuffing," warned Don. "It's almost half-past
now. And I've got three solid pages of this
rot to do. Dry up, like a good pal."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE SEARCH OF ADVENTURE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">By</span> that time Brimfield had played her second
game and lost it, 6 to 14, to Canterbury High
School. Canterbury was not considered very
formidable and Brimfield usually had little trouble
with her. But this year things had gone wrong
from the start of the game to the finish, wrong,
that is, from Brimfield's point of view. Fumbling
had been much in evidence and poor judgment
even more. Carmine had worked like a Trojan at
quarter-back for two periods, but had somehow
failed to display his usually good generalship,
and McPhee, who had taken his place at the beginning
of the second half, while he ran the team
well, twice dropped punts in the backfield, one of
which accounted for Canterbury's second touchdown
and goal. Oddly enough, it was the veterans
who failed most signally to live up to expectations,
and of all the veterans Tom Hall was the worst
offender. Possibly Tom's shoulder still bothered
him, but even that couldn't have accounted for all
his shortcomings. Crewe, who played tackle beside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Tom, was not a very steady man, and Tom's
errors threw him off his game badly, with the
result that, until Coach Robey put Pryme in for
Tom in the third period, Canterbury made a
lamentable number of gains at the right of the
Brimfield line. Even Tim Otis, usually undisturbed
by anything short of an earthquake, was
affected by the playing of the others and finally
had what he called a "brain-storm" in the third
period, getting the signals twisted and being
thrown back for an eight-yard loss. That misadventure
bothered him so that he was heartily glad
when Gordon was rushed in a few minutes later.</div>

<p>The team took the beating to heart and the
school at large was disposed to indulge in sarcasm
and bitterness. Only Coach Robey seemed undisturbed.
He lavished no praise, you may be sure,
but, on the other hand, neither did he utter any
criticism after the contest was over. Instead, he
laid off more than half the line-up on Monday and
Tuesday, and, since the weather continued almost
unseasonably warm, the rest was just what the
fellows needed. Wednesday's practice went with
a new snap and vim and those who broiled in the
afternoon sun and watched it found grounds for
hope.</p>

<p>It was on Wednesday that Don began his connection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
with the second team, and by then the injured
hand was so well along that he was able to
discard the glove. Three days of kindergarten
work followed, with, on Saturday, a short signal
drill. The first team journeyed away that afternoon
to play Miter Hill School, and Don would
have liked very much to have gone along. But
Boots put his charges through a good, hard hour
and a half of work, and Don had all he could
attend to at home. Just before supper he did,
however, walk down to the station and meet Tim
when the team arrived home. Tim, who seemed
remarkably fresh for a youth who had played
through the most of four ten-minute periods,
scorned the coach and he and Don footed it back.</p>

<p>"Twenty to nothing, my boy," said Tim exultantly.
"They never had a look-in. It was
some game, believe me, dearie! And I want to
tell you, too, that Miter Hill is fifty per cent better
than Canterbury ever thought of being!"</p>

<p>"That's fine," said Don. "What sort of a game
did you play?"</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I was the life of the party. Got off
two nice little runs, one for thirty and the other
for forty-five yards. Got a touchdown the second
time. I wouldn't have, though, if Steve hadn't
paced me most the way down and put the quarter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
out. Old Steve played like a whirlwind today.
We all did, I guess. There was only one fumble,
and that wasn't anyone's fault. Holt got a forward
pass and a Miter Hill chap plunged into him
and just about knocked the breath out of him and
he let go of the ball."</p>

<p>"Twenty to nothing? Three touchdowns,
then."</p>

<p>"Yep, and Rollins only missed one goal. Rollins
scored once, I scored once and Steve took over
the last one."</p>

<p>"Forward pass?"</p>

<p>"No, end-around. It went off great, too. We
were way back on the eighteen yards, I think it
was, and we worked the fake forward pass play,
with Steve taking the ball from Carmine. We
fooled them finely. They never got onto it at all
until Steve was over the line. Some of the fellows
who were doing so much grousing last week
ought to have come along today and seen some
real football. Robey was as pleased as anything.
You could tell that because he looked sort of cross
and told us how bad we were!"</p>

<p>"Wish I'd seen it," mourned Don.</p>

<p>"It was some game, all right, all right! We're
going to have a modest celebration this evening;
just Tom Hall and Clint Thayer and Hap Crewe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
maybe, and yours truly. Better come along. Will
you?"</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just down to the village. We'll leave the
window open."</p>

<p>"You'll get nabbed if you try that," demurred
Don. "Better not, Tim."</p>

<p>"Well, we may be back by ten. No harm in
having a way open in case something delays us,
though. We'll have a little feed at the Inn, you
know, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be a chump," growled Don. "You're
in training and you know mighty well Robey won't
stand for any funny-business."</p>

<p>"What Robey doesn't know isn't going to hurt
him," replied Tim untroubledly. "And he won't
know anything about this because he's off for
home on the seven o'clock train. Tom heard him
tell Steve he wouldn't be back until Monday
noon."</p>

<p>"Yes, but someone will see you and Robey'll
hear of it. And then you'll get the dickens from
him and be hauled up to the office. Better not
risk it, Timmy."</p>

<p>"Gee, you're worse than Mr. Poe's crow! Or
was it a raven? What's the difference, anyhow?
Now don't tell me they're both anthropeds or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
pods, or whatever it is, because I'm onto you as
a disseminator of knowledge! I never got even
with you yet for calling me 'something like a
human being'."</p>

<p>"I'll take it back, then; you aren't. But, just
the same, Tim, I wish you'd cut out the celebration."</p>

<p>"You're all the time interfering with my innocent
pleasures," protested Tim. "Why, bless
you, dearie, we aren't going to cut-up. We're
merely going to stroll quietly to the village, trolling
a song, mayhap, and look in the windows."</p>

<p>"That'll take you a long time," Don laughed.
"There are only half a dozen."</p>

<p>"Wrong. A fellow opened a watchmaker's
emporium next door to the post office t'other day
and has a most fascinating window. It has four
alarm clocks, three pairs of cuff-links and a
chronometer in it! Oh, it's swell! Do you realise,
Don, that slowly but surely our little village is
taking on the&mdash;the semblance of a metropolis?
All we want is a movie palace!"</p>

<p>"Let's start one. They say there's a lot of
money in them."</p>

<p>"Bet there is! We've got three or four at
home, and they're peaches. Full every minute,
too. I went a lot last Summer; had filmitis, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
guess. But how about the party? Will you come
along?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, Don! Have a heart! Be one of
our merry gang."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not, thank you. I like Josh well
enough, but I don't like to stand on the carpet
and hear him say 'Until further notice, Gilbert.'
Nothing doing, Tim!"</p>

<p>And Don remained adamant the rest of the way
to school and while they made a hurried toilet and
rushed to dining hall in an effort to reach it before
the food gave out.</p>

<p>The team members received an ovation that
evening when they entered the dining hall. It
seemed as if the school wanted to make up for its
unkindness of a week before. Some few of the
fellows, recalling sarcastic comments overheard,
were inclined to be haughty and unforgiving, but
eventually they melted. Don, now at the second
training-table, presided over by Mr. Boutelle, saw
that Coach Robey's chair was vacant, which fact
bore out Tim's statement that the coach had gone
home over Sunday. But, even granting that, Don
didn't approve of Tim's celebration, for, as he
very well knew, after a football victory fellows
were very likely to be carried away by their enthusiasm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and to forget such trifling things as
rules and regulations. He determined to try
again to dissuade Tim after supper.</p>

<p>But Tim, who was in a very cheerful and expansive
mood, refused to be dissuaded. Instead, he
turned the tables and begged so hard for Don to
come with him that Don finally relented. After
all, there was no harm in the excursion if they got
permission and were back in hall by ten o'clock.
And it was a wonderfully pleasant, warm evening,
much too fine an evening to spend indoors, and&mdash;well,
secretly, Don wanted some fun as much as
any of them, perhaps!</p>

<p>Permission was easily obtained and at seven
they met Tom Hall and Clint Thayer in front of
Torrence. Crewe failed them, but Tim said it
didn't matter; that there were only four "Three
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Muskateers'">Musketeers</ins>" anyhow! So they set off for the
village in high spirits, through a warm, fragrant,
star-lighted evening, with no settled plan of action
in mind save to do about as they liked for the succeeding
three hours. Clint Thayer had a strip of
plaster across the saddle of his nose, which gave
him a strangely benign expression. Tom walked
a bit stiffly and confessed to "a peach of a shin,"
which probably meant something quite different
from what it suggested. Only Tim, of the three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
first team fellows, had emerged unscathed, and he
referred to the fact in an unpleasantly superior
manner which brought from Tom Hall the remark
that it was easy enough to get through a game
without any knocks if you didn't do anything!
Whereupon Tim flicked him across the cheek with
an imaginary glove, the challenge was issued and
accepted and the two fought an exciting duel with
rapiers&mdash;as imaginary as the glove&mdash;on the sidewalk,
feinting, thrusting, parrying, until Clint
cried "The guard! The guard!" and they all
raced down the road to the nearest lamp-post,
where Tim insisted on looking to his wounds. To
hear him tell it, he was as full of holes as a sieve,
while, on the same authority, Tom was a dead man.
Tom denied being dead, but Tim insisted and refused
to pay any heed to him all the rest of the way
to the village on the ground that, being dead, Tom
had no business to talk.</p>

<p>But when they reached what Tim called "the
heart of the city" Tom was allowed to come to life
again. The heart of the city consisted of the
junction of two village streets whereon were
located the diminutive town hall, the post office,
a fire house and five stores. They began with the
druggist's, ranging themselves in front of one of
the two windows and pretending to be overwhelmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
with the beauty and magnificence of the
goods displayed.</p>

<p>"What beautiful soap," exclaimed Tom. "I
never saw such beautiful soap, fellows. Pink and
green and white! Looks almost good enough to
wash with, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"And get on to the lovely toilet set in the green
velvet box," begged Tim awedly. "Scissors and
brushes and little do-funnies and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to buy a bottle of that hair-grower,"
announced Don. "I want to raise a beard."</p>

<p>"Let's get a bottle and present it to Uncle Sim,"
suggested Clint. Uncle Sim was Mr. Simkins, the
Greek and Latin instructor, and was noticeably
bald. The others chuckled and thought very well
of the suggestion until Tom discovered that the
price, as stated on the label, was one whole dollar.
They had, they decided, better uses for what little
money they carried. Eventually they went inside,
and sat on stools in front of the small soda fountain
and drank gaily-coloured concoctions which,
according to Tim, later, sounded better than they
tasted. Having exhausted the amusement to be
derived from the drug store, they went to the fire
house next door and, pressing their noses against
the glass, debated what would happen if an alarm
was rung in. There was a box beside the doors, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
most tempting red box and Tim eyed it longingly
until Don led him gently but firmly away from
temptation.</p>

<p>In the small store across the street they examined
all the books and magazines displayed on the
counters, which didn't take long, as literature was
not a large part of the stock. Tim spent ten
cents for a football guide, explaining that he had
always wanted to know some of the rules of that
game! Don bought some candy and Clint a bag of
peanuts, although the others protested that if they
ate truck they'd spoil their appetites for real food.
The force of the protest was somewhat marred by
the actions of the protestants, who helped themselves
liberally to the contents of the two bags.</p>

<p>There was a convenient fence a few steps along
the street and they perched themselves on the top
rail and consumed the peanuts and candy and
watched the "rush of the great city," to again
quote the poetic Tim. During the next twenty
minutes exactly eight carriages and four automobiles
entered their range of vision; and at that
Clint insisted that they had counted one automobile
twice. He accused it of going around the block
in order to add to the confusion. Possibly some
three dozen people passed within sight, although
that may have been a too liberal estimate. Tom at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
last declared that he couldn't stand the excitement
any longer; that his brain reeled and his eyes
ached; and that he was going to find a quiet spot
far from the dizzy whirl. So they adjourned to the
grocery and butcher shop and talked learnedly of
loins and shoulders and ribs. And Clint dragged
what he alluded to as a "brisket" into the conversation
to the confusion of the others, who had
never heard of it and didn't believe in it anyway.
Tom said Clint meant "biscuit" and that this
wasn't a bakery. Then he caught sight of some
rather pathetic and unseasonable radishes and,
having a passion for radishes, went in and purchased
four bunches. That outlay led to an expenditure
for salt, and as a large, round pasteboard
carton of it was the least they could buy,
they retreated down the street to the Inn porch,
trickled the salt along the top of the railing, drew
up chairs and consumed the radishes at their
leisure. All, that is, save Tim. Tim didn't like
radishes, called them "fire-crackers" and pretended
to be deeply disgusted with his companions
for eating them.</p>

<p>When the radishes were consumed they invaded
the Inn and assaulted the water tank in force.
Then, as there were practically no sights left to be
viewed, they went back to their chairs and, as Tom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
had it, waited for inspiration. Don was for trolleying
over to the shore, having a dip in the ocean
and returning to school in good time. But Tim
pointed out that the trolley line was a good half-mile
distant, that he had not filled himself with
radishes and was consequently quite famished for
food and favoured remaining within easy distance
of the Inn so that, in case he grew faint, he could
reach sustenance. Don's motion was defeated. In
view of what eventually occurred, that was, perhaps,
unfortunate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>FIGHTING FIRE</h3>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">This</span>," said Tim presently, "is a bit dull, if you
ask me. I came out for some excitement. Let's
do something."</div>

<p>"What?" asked Clint, yawning loudly.</p>

<p>"Let's eat."</p>

<p>The others groaned.</p>

<p>"That's all right for you chaps, but I'm getting
hungry," Tim asserted. "I thought we were
going to have a feed. They'll be closing this place
up the first thing we know. How about a rarebit,
fellows?"</p>

<p>"Oh, let's wait awhile," said Don. "Let's take
a walk and get up an appetite."</p>

<p>"Walk!" jeered Tim. "Gee, I've walked
enough. And there's nothing the matter with my
appetite right now. Tell you what&mdash;&mdash;" Tim
paused. An automobile was stopping in front of
the Inn. The headlights suddenly dimmed and the
single occupant, a tall man in a light overcoat, got
out, walked up the path, ascended the steps and
passed into the house. "Now, who's he?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Tim. "Say, I wish he'd loan us his car for
awhile."</p>

<p>"Run in and ask him," suggested Tom. "He
looked kind."</p>

<p>"Maybe he'd give us a ride if we asked him,"
pursued Tim. "It's a peach of a car; foreign, I
guess."</p>

<p>"It's a Mercy Dear," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Or a Fierce Sorrow," hazarded Clint.</p>

<p>"Bet you it's a Cheerless," said Don, "or a
Backhard."</p>

<p>"Don't care what it is," persisted Tim. "I
want a ride in it."</p>

<p>"Let's go down and stand around it with our
fingers in our mouths," said Tom, with a chuckle.
"Perhaps he will take pity on us and ask us in."</p>

<p>"Or we might open the door for him," offered
Don.</p>

<p>At that moment Clint, who had left his chair to
lean across the railing and gaze past the end of
the porch, interrupted with an exclamation. "Say,
fellows, what's that light over there?" he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Fire, by jingo!" cried Tim.</p>

<p>"That's what!" agreed Tom. "Say, you don't
suppose it's the school, do you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not! The school's over that way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Besides, that fire's away off; maybe two miles.
Come on!" And Clint started for the steps.</p>

<p>"Wait!" called Tim. "I want to see the engine
come out. Bet you it's a fine sight! Anyway, we
can't foot it two miles."</p>

<p>"Maybe it isn't that far," said Don. "Fires
look further than they are sometimes."</p>

<p>"Yes, and nearer, too," replied Tim. "Think
we ought to run over and tell them about it?"</p>

<p>But that question was speedily answered by
the sudden clanging of a gong inside the fire
house, followed by the sound of running footsteps
and, an instant later, the wild alarm of the shrill-tongued
bell in the little belfry.</p>

<p>"My word!" exclaimed Tom. "I didn't know
there were so many folks in the town!" Already
a small-sized crowd had gathered in front of the
fire house, some fifty yards up the street. The
doors rolled open and a figure pushed through the
throng and loped across the street and disappeared.
The bell clanged on and on. Don and
Clint and Tom made a dash for the steps. Tim
slid over the railing. But before any of them had
more than reached the sidewalk the tall owner of
the automobile catapulted himself down the steps,
hailing them as he came.</p>

<p>"Where is it, boys?" he shouted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Over there," answered Clint, pointing. But
the glow in the sky was scarcely visible from the
sidewalk and they all swarmed back to the porch
again.</p>

<p>"I see," said the man. "Some farm house, I
guess. They'll know at the fire house." He
sprang down the steps again, the boys streaming
after him. He was already in the car when Tim
asked breathlessly: "You going, sir?"</p>

<p>"Sure! Want to come? Pile in, then. There
are some packages in there. Look out for
them."</p>

<p>Clint had already put his foot down hard on
something that, whatever it might be, was never
meant to be walked on, but he made no mention of
the fact. The car leaped forward, swung to the
right, stopped with a jerk six inches from a lamp-post,
backed, straightened out and careened along
to the fire house. All was excitement there. Men
were rushing into the building and rushing out
again, agitatedly donning rubber coats and hats.
Speculation was rife. A score of voices argued as
to the location of the fire. The throng swayed
back and forth. The man in the car demanded information
as he drew up at the curb and a dozen
answers were flung at him. Then a small, fat man
ran up and leaned excitedly across the front of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
auto. "Hello, Mr. Brady!" he panted. "You
going out there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I've got a load, Johnson. Where
is it?"</p>

<p>"Don't no one seem to know. Jim Cogswell
knows, but he's gone for the horses."</p>

<p>"Look out! Here they come!" "Get that auto
out of the way there!" "Stand aside, everyone!"
"Get a move on, Jim!" A lean little man in his
shirt sleeves suddenly appeared leading two jogging
horses, while a third horse trotted along behind.
The crowd scampered aside and the horses
beat a tattoo on the floor as they wheeled to their
places. Mr. Brady jumped from his seat, pushed
his way through the crowd as it closed in again
about the doorway and disappeared. Tim
whooped with delight.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" he demanded. "Didn't
I say it would be a great sight? Gee, I haven't
had such a good time since I had the measles!"</p>

<p>Mr. Brady reappeared, scrambled back to his
seat and slammed the door behind him. "Jim says
it's Corrigan's barn," he said. "Sit tight, boys!"
The car leaped forward once more, took the first
corner at twenty miles an hour, took the next at
thirty and then, in the middle of a firm, hard road,
simply roared away into the starlit darkness, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
headlights throwing a great white radiance ahead.
Tim, on the front seat, whipped off his cap and
stuffed it into his pocket. Behind, the three boys
huddled themselves low in the wide seat while the
wind tore past them.</p>

<p>"Must be going ninety miles an hour!" gasped
Clint.</p>

<p>"Suppose we bust something!" said Tom
awedly.</p>

<p>Don braced his feet against the foot-rail. "Let
it bust!" he answered exultantly.</p>

<p>That was a memorable ride. Tim owned afterward
that he thought he had ridden fast once or
twice before, but that he was mistaken. "I
watched that speedometer from the time we turned
the second corner," he declared, "and it never
showed less than fifty-three and was generally
around sixty! If I hadn't been so excited I'd been
scared to death!"</p>

<p>Now and then one of the boys behind looked
back along the road, but if anyone was following
them the fact wasn't apparent. Almost before
they were conscious of having travelled any distance
the car topped a slight hill at a dizzy speed
and the conflagration was in sight. A quarter of
a mile distant a big barn was burning merrily.
The car slowed down at the foot of the descent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
swung into a lane and pitched and careened toward
the burning structure. Other buildings were clustered
about the barn and a good-sized white dwelling
house stood in dangerous proximity. Between
house and barn, standing out black against the
orange glow of the fire, was a group of women and
children, while a few men, not more than a half-dozen
it seemed, were wandering hither and
thither in the radiance. A horse with trailing
halter snorted and dashed to safety as the automobile
turned from the lane and came to a stop under
an apple tree.</p>

<p>"Far as we go!" shouted Mr. Brady. "Come
on, boys, and lend a hand!"</p>

<p>The lights dimmed, the engine stopped and the
occupants of the car scrambled out and ran up
the lane. "They can't save that barn," panted
Mr. Brady, "but they'd ought to save the rest of
them."</p>

<p>A man attired principally in a pair of overalls
and a flannel shirt and carrying an empty bucket
advanced to meet them.</p>

<p>"Is the engine coming?" he asked listlessly.</p>

<p>"They hadn't started when I left," answered
Mr. Brady, "and I guess you needn't look for them
for fifteen or twenty minutes. Got any water
handy when it does come?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got a tank full up there, and there's a
pond behind the house. But I don't know's they
can do anything. Looks to me like everything's
bound to go. Well, I got insurance."</p>

<p>"Got plenty of buckets?" asked Mr. Brady,
peeling off his coat. "How many men are here?"</p>

<p>"About six or seven, I guess. Yes, there's buckets
enough, but the heat's so fierce&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Animals all out?"</p>

<p>"There's some pigs down there. We tried to
chase 'em out, but the plaguy things wouldn't go.
We got the horses and cows out and a couple o'
wagons. All my hay's done for, though. And
there's a heap o' machinery in there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, we can save the other buildings, can't
we?" asked Mr. Brady impatiently. "Get your
buckets and your men together, Corrigan. Here
are five of us, and we can make a line and keep the
roofs wet down until the engine comes, I guess.
Send the women for all the pails and things you've
got. Get a hustle on, man!"</p>

<p>Mr. Corrigan hesitated a moment and then trotted
away. The water supply was contained in a
wooden tank set some ten feet above ground, and
high beyond that, dimly discernible through the
cloud of smoke, the spectral arms of a wind-mill
revolved imperturbably. Mr. Brady, followed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the boys, went on around to the further side of the
burning building. It was a huge hip-roofed structure.
One end, that nearest the house, was already
falling, and the tons of crackling hay in the mows
glowed like a furnace. The heat, even at the foot
of the wind-mill, a hundred feet or more away, was
almost intolerable. A row of one-story buildings
ran along one side of the barn, so near that the
flying sparks blew over rather than on to them.
Several other detached structures stood at greater
distances. Mr. Brady, surveying the scene, shook
his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Guess he's right," he said. "There's not
much use trying to save those nearer buildings.
We couldn't stay on those roofs a minute. I guess
the chief danger will be from sparks lighting on
the house and that creamery there. Things are
mighty dry."</p>

<p>Four or five men dangling empty buckets, one of
them Mr. Corrigan's son and the others neighbours,
came up and asked about the fire department
and Mr. Brady repeated what he had told
the older man. "What we've got to do," he continued,
"is to keep the roof on the house and the
dairy wet. Those sparks are flying all over them.
What's that small building over there?"</p>

<p>"That's the ice-house, Mr. Brady."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we won't bother about that. How many
are there of us?"</p>

<p>"Six, I guess," said one of the men, but another
corrected him.</p>

<p>"Old Man Meredith and Tom Young just drove
in," he announced. "That makes eight of us, and
there's five of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, come on, then," Mr. Brady interrupted
briskly. "You fellows get your pails full and look
after the dairy. Get on the roof, a couple of you,
and keep it wet down. The rest can lug water.
Got a ladder handy? All right. Somebody fetch
it in a hurry. Hold on! Isn't there water in the
dairy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, plenty of it."</p>

<p>"Then fill your buckets inside and hand them up
to the men on the roof. I'll take my gang and go
over to the house."</p>

<p>The following half-hour was a busy time for the
four boys. Mr. Brady and Don stood precariously
athwart the ridge of the house roof while Tim and
Clint and Tom, later assisted by others, filled buckets
in the kitchen, raced up two flights of stairs
and a short ladder&mdash;often losing half of their burden
on the way&mdash;and passed them through a skylight
to those outside. A dozen times the dry
shingles caught fire under the rain of sparks, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Mr. Brady, climbing along the ridge like a cat,
tossing buckets of water with unerring precision,
kept the fire at bay. It was warm work for all.
On the roof the heat of the fire was unpleasantly
apparent, while in the house it was stiflingly close
and the work of carrying the pails up and down
stairs soon had the three boys in a fine perspiration
and badly off for breath!</p>

<p>When the engines arrived, heralded by loud acclaim
from the onlookers, who had by then multiplied
remarkably, the barn was merely a huge
pyre of glowing hay and burning timbers, only one
far corner remaining erect. The piggery and adjoining
buildings were ablaze in several places.
The creamery roof had caught once or twice, but
each time the flames had been subdued. If the
engine and hose-cart and two carriages bearing
members of the volunteer fire department had been
slow in arriving, at least the fire-fighters got to
work expeditiously and with surprisingly little
confusion. Don, pausing for a moment in his
labour of passing buckets to look down, decided
that Brimfield had no cause to be ashamed of its
department. In a jiffy the hose-cart was rattling
across the yard&mdash;and, incidentally, some flower
beds&mdash;in the direction of the pond behind the house,
and a moment or two later the engine was pumping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
vigorously and a fine stream of water was wetting
down the roofs of the threatened structures.
Axes bit into charring timbers, sparks flew, enthusiastic,
rubber-clad firemen dashed here and there,
shouting loudly, the audience cheered and the
worst was over!</p>

<p>With the collapse of the remaining section of
barn wall the danger from sparks was past, and,
emptying one final bucket, Mr. Brady, followed by
a very wet, very tired and very warm Don, crept
back through the skylight and joined the others
below. Mr. Brady rescued his coat, led the way
to the kitchen pump and drank long and copiously,
setting an example enthusiastically emulated by
the boys. Tim declared that if he drank as much
as he wanted there wouldn't be enough water left
to put out the fire with!</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said Mr. Brady, finally setting
down the dipper and drawing a long breath, "I
guess we did pretty well for amateurs, eh? I don't
know whether we get any thanks, for I've a suspicion
that Corrigan would have been just as
pleased if everything had gone. From the way he
talked when we got here I guess he wanted the
insurance more'n he did the buildings!" Mr.
Brady chuckled. "Well, we put one over on him
in that case, eh? Want to stick around much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
longer? I guess most of the fun's over; unless
they're going to serve some of that roast pig!"</p>

<p>"They got the pigs out," chuckled Tim. "They
were running around here awhile ago like crazy.
About twenty of them, big and little, squealing
and getting between people's feet. Those pigs had
the time of their lives!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, suppose we start along home?"
said Mr. Brady. "You fellows ready?"</p>

<p>They agreed that they were. The remains of the
barn were already blackening, and, while the firemen,
evidently determined to make the most of the
occasion, were still swinging axes and pouring
water on the already extinguished and well-soaked
buildings, there was no danger of further trouble.
Mr. Corrigan, surrounded by a group of sympathetic
neighbours, was cataloguing his losses and
Mr. Brady called to him as they passed.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Corrigan! Sorry for you, but
you've saved your house anyway!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Brady. I'm greatly obliged to
you, sir, and them young fellers, too. It's a bit of
a loss, sir, but there's pretty good insurance."</p>

<p>"That's fortunate. Good-night!" Mr. Brady
chuckled as they went on into the darkness of the
orchard. "Bet you he's downright peeved with
us, boys, for wetting that roof down! I happen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to know that he's been losing money on this place
for five years and been trying to sell it for a
twelvemonth."</p>

<p>"You don't suppose," began Tom, "that he&mdash;er&mdash;that
he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Set the fire? Well, I'd rather not suppose
about that. As there's no evidence against him
we'd better give him the benefit of the doubt, I
guess."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>COACHING THE TACKLES</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> ride back was far less exciting. Mr. Brady
drove the big car leisurely and conversed with
Clint, who had succeeded to the seat of honour in
front. Mr. Brady, it appeared, had a poultry
farm some distance on the other side of Brimfield.
He seemed a trifle surprised and pained when he
discovered that Clint had never heard of the Cedar
Ridge Poultry Farm, and at once issued an invitation
to visit it.</div>

<p>"You come over some time and I'll show you
some stock that'll open your eyes. Bring your
friends along. Tell the conductor on the trolley
where you want to go and he'll set you down right
at my gate. You can't miss it, though, anyhow,
for I've got nearly a quarter of a mile of houses
there. Silver Campines are my specialty. Raise
a few White Wyandottes, too. You wouldn't
think to look at me that the doctors came mighty
near giving me up ten or eleven years ago, eh?
Did, though. That was just after I finished college.
They said the only thing would save me was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
hiking out to Colorado or Arizona or New Mexico.
Some said one place and some said another. Seeing
that they couldn't decide, I settled the question
myself. Came out here, bought ten acres of
land&mdash;I've got nearly forty now&mdash;and lived in a
tent one Summer while my house was building.
Doctors said it wouldn't do, but I fooled them.
Slept out of doors every night, worked like a slave
fourteen hours a day and put on flesh right from
the start. I'm not what you'd call fat now, I guess,
but you ought to have seen me then! An old chap
I had putting up my first chicken house told me he
could work me in nicely for a roosting pole! Went
back to one of the doctors three years ago and had
him look me over. He had to admit that I was a
pretty healthy specimen. You could see that he
was downright peeved about it, though!" Mr.
Brady chuckled. "Then I settled the matter to
my own satisfaction by taking out some life insurance.
When I got my policy I stopped worrying
about my health. You drop over some afternoon
and let me show you how to live like a white man
and make a little money, too. There's no life like
it, and I wouldn't go back to the city if they gave
me the Ritz-Carlton to live in!"</p>


<p>Clint responded that he and the others would
like very much to visit Cedar Ridge some day, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
that just now they were all pretty busy in the
afternoons with football. That struck a responsive
chord and Mr. Brady harked back to his school
and college days when he, too, had fondled the pigskin.
"I wasn't much of a player, though," he
acknowledged. "I was sort of tall and puny-looking
and not very strong. Still, I did get into my
school team in my senior year and played on my
freshman team in college. The next year I had
to give it up, though. I'd like to come over some
day and see you fellows play. I've always been
intending to. I haven't seen a real smashing football
game for years. That's funny, too, for I can
remember the time when I used to think that if I
could get on my 'varsity eleven I'd die happy."
He laughed as he swept the searchlights around a
corner. "A man's ambitions change, don't they?
Now what I want to do is to raise the champion
egg producer. I'm going to do it, too, before
long."</p>

<p>And Clint quite believed it. Any man, he told
himself, who could take command of a situation
as Mr. Brady had that evening, and who could
make enough money in the poultry business to own
a three-thousand dollar automobile was capable
of anything!</p>

<p>When they approached the town Mr. Brady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
swung off to the left, explaining that he would take
the boys up to the school. There was a moment
of silence and then Clint protested weakly.
"Shucks," was the reply, "it won't take five minutes
longer, and after the way you fellows have
worked tonight you don't deserve to have to walk
home!"</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;then I guess you'd better let us
out at the corner," said Tim. "We'd hate to wake
up the masters, Mr. Brady."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, eh?" Mr. Brady laughed loudly.
"Stayed out too late, have you?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we have, sir," said Clint. "We're
supposed to be in hall before ten and it's long
after that now. If you'll let us out at the corner
of the grounds we can sort of sneak around back
and maybe get in without being seen. Faculty's
beastly strict about outstaying leave."</p>

<p>The car crossed the railroad track and presently
pulled up quietly in the gloom of the trees along
the road and the four boys noiselessly descended,
shook hands, promised to pay a visit some day to
Cedar Ridge and stole off to the right through the
darkness. A moment later the tiny red light of the
automobile vanished from sight. Tim called a halt
at the wall. "You'd better bunk out with us tonight,
Clint," he whispered. "We'll beat it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
around back of the gym and get in the shadows of
the buildings. Say, Don, you're sure we left that
window unlatched?"</p>

<p>"Of course we did! It hasn't been closed for a
week."</p>

<p>"Then forward, my brave comrades! If anyone
sees us we'd better scatter and hide out for
awhile."</p>

<p>They climbed over a stone wall and made their
way through a grove adjoining the school grounds,
keeping close to the boundary fence. It was as
dark as pitch in the woods and every now and then
one or another would walk into a tree or fall over
a root. Don's teeth were chattering like <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'castenets'">castanets</ins>,
for the night had grown cooler and a little breeze
was blowing from the west, and his clothing
was still far from dry. They crept past the
back of the Cottage very cautiously, for there
were lights upstairs and down, and breathed
easier when the black bulk of the gymnasium
loomed before them and they could crawl over the
fence and drop back into school ground. From
the corner of the gymnasium to Billings was a long
distance, and looked just now longer than it ever
had before. Also, in spite of the fact that there
was no moon, the night was surprisingly light and
Tim scowled disapprovingly at the stars as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
paused for an instant at the corner of the building
to get their breaths.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 255px;">
<img src="images/gs02.jpg" width="255" height="400" alt="Finally, Don was unceremoniously yanked up and through" title="Finally, Don was unceremoniously yanked up and through" />
<span class="caption">Finally, Don was unceremoniously yanked up and through</span>
</div>

<p>"Keep low," advised Tim, "and make for Torrence.
Then we'll stay close to the walls of the
buildings. You want to see if there's a window
open in Torrence, Clint?"</p>

<p>"No, I'll stay with you fellows. I'd probably
walk into a chair or a table and someone would
take me for a burglar."</p>

<p>"Come on, then. Haste to yon enfolding darkness!"</p>

<p>They "hasted," and a second or two after were
creeping, doubled up lest their heads show above
the darkened windows and arouse unwelcome curiosity,
along the rear of Torrence. Then they raced
across the space dividing Torrence from Main
Hall and repeated the proceedings until, finally,
they were under the windows of Number 6 Billings.
Both were open at the bottom and their
doubts and tribulations were at an end. Clint
was assisted in first, Tom followed and then Tim
and, finally, Don was unceremoniously yanked up
and through.</p>

<p>"Eureka!" breathed Tim. "Can you make it
to your room, Tom? If you don't want to risk it
you can bunk out here on the window-seat or
somewhere."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may have half of my bed," offered Don.
But Tom was already removing his shoes.</p>

<p>"If Horace hears me," he whispered, "he's got
better ears than I think he has. Good-night, fellows.
We had a bully time, even if we didn't get
that rarebit!"</p>

<p>Tim groaned hollowly. "There! Now you've
gone and reminded me that I'm starved to
death!"</p>

<p>"Shut up," warned Don. "Don't forget that
Horace's bedroom is right there." He nodded
toward the wall. "Beat it, Tom, and don't fall
over your feet!"</p>

<p>The door opened soundlessly, closed again and
Tom was gone. They listened, and, although the
transom was slightly open, not a creak or a shuffle
reached them. "He's all right," whispered Tim.
"Me for bed, fellows. Want to come in with
me, Clint, or will you luxuriate on the window-seat?"</p>

<p>"Window-seat, thanks. Got a coat or something?"</p>

<p>Tim pulled a comforter from the closet shelf
and tossed it to him, and quietly and quickly they
got out of their clothes and sought their couches.
Ten minutes later three very healthy snores alone
disturbed the silence of Number 6.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning Clint joined the others and
walked unobtrusively along the Row with them in
the direction of Wendell and breakfast, but when
he reached Torrence he quite as unobtrusively
slipped through the doorway and sought his room
to repair his appearance and relieve the anxiety
of Amory Byrd. And that seemed to conclude the
adventure for all hands, and Don, for one, was
extremely thankful that they had escaped detection
and the punishment which would have certainly
followed. But that Sunday afternoon,
while on his way to Torrence to recover a book
which Leroy Draper had borrowed in the Spring
and neglected to return, he fell in with Harry
Walton and made the disconcerting discovery that
he had congratulated himself too soon. Don had
no particular liking for Walton, although he by
no means held him in the disdain that Amy Byrd
and some others did, and he was a little surprised
when Harry fell into step beside him.</p>

<p>"Have a good time last night?" asked Harry
with an ingratiating leer.</p>

<p>"Last night?" echoed Don vacantly. He remembered
then that Lawton roomed in Number
20 Billings, directly above Number 6. "What
about last night?"</p>

<p>Harry winked meaningly and chuckled. "Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
I guess there was a party, wasn't there? I noticed
you got home sort of late."</p>

<p>"Did I? What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"I happened to be looking out my window, Don.
It was sort of hot and I wasn't sleepy. Who were
the other fellows?"</p>

<p>"Other fellows? I guess you didn't see any
others, Walton."</p>

<p>Harry's saturnine countenance again wreathed
itself with a growing grin. "Didn't, eh? All
right. I probably imagined them."</p>

<p>"Maybe you were asleep and dreamed it," said
Don gravely. "Guess you must have, Walton."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not going to talk, Don. You needn't
be afraid of that."</p>

<p>"I'm not," responded the other drily. "Well,
I'm going in here. So long, Walton."</p>

<p>"Bye, Don. I'm mum."</p>

<p>Don nodded and entered Torrence, but on the
way upstairs he frowned disgustedly. He didn't
believe for an instant that Walton would deliberately
get them into trouble, but he might talk so
much that the facts would eventually work around
to one of the masters. Don wished that almost
any fellow he knew save Walton had witnessed
that entry by the window of Number 6. Later,
when he returned from his visit to Roy Draper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
without the book, by the way, since it had mysteriously
disappeared, he recounted his conversation
with Walton to Tim. Tim didn't let it bother him
any, however.</p>

<p>"Harry won't give us away. Why should he?
Besides, if he did he would know mighty well that
I'd spoil his brunette beauty!"</p>

<p>"Well, he may tell it around and Horace or
somebody'll hear it. That's all I'm worrying
about."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Donald. Keep a clear conscience
and you'll never know what worry is. That's my
philosophy."</p>

<p>Don smiled and dismissed the matter from consideration.</p>

<p>On Monday he had his first try at coaching the
second team tackles and found that, after all, he got
on fairly well. There were four candidates for
the positions and two of them, Kirkwell and Merton,
promised well. Kirkwell, in fact, had already
had a full season of experience on the second.
Merton was a graduate from his last year's hall
team. The other two, Brace and Goodhugh, were
novices and had everything to learn, and it was
with them that Don laboured the hardest. Monday's
practice ended with a ten-minute scrimmage
between two hastily selected teams, and Don,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
for the first time that fall, played in his old position
of left guard. Merton, who opposed him,
found that he still had much to learn.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, after a long and grilling tackling
practice at the dummy, Coach Boutelle announced
his line-up for the scrimmage against the first
team, and Don was disappointed to find that Kirkwell
and not he was down for left guard. The right
guard position went to Merton. Don, with Mr.
Boutelle and a half-dozen of the more promising
substitutes, followed their team about the field,
Boots criticising and driving and Don breaking
in with hurried instructions to the guards. The
first team had no trouble in piling up four touchdowns
that afternoon, even though three regulars
were still out of the line-up. Between the short
periods Don coached Kirkwell and Merton again,
and Kirkwell, who was a decent chap but fancied
himself a bit, was inclined to resent it.</p>

<p>"Chop it off, Gilbert," he said finally. "Give a
fellow a chance to use his own brains a little. I'm
no greenhorn, you know. I played guard all last
year on this team."</p>

<p>"I know you did," answered Don. "And I
don't say you can't play your position all right.
But the best of us make mistakes, and Boots has
told me to look out for them and try and correct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
them. I'd a lot rather be playing than doing this,
Kirkwell, but while I am doing it I'm going to do
it the best I know how. A fellow who isn't in the
game sees a lot the player doesn't, and when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. Only don't tell me stuff I know
as well as I know my name, Gilbert. Don't
nag."</p>

<p>"Sorry. I'll try not to. But you see what I
mean about that stiff-arm business, don't you?
Don't get out of position when you're not sure
where the play's coming, Kirkwell. Stiff-arm
your man and hold him off until you see what's
doing. Then you can play him right or left or
shove him back. Once or twice you waited too
long to find out where the play was coming and
you didn't hold your man off. Get me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we don't all play the position the
same way, you know. What's the good of sparring
with your man when you've got to find where
the play's coming? You can't watch the ball and
your opponent too, can you?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't sound reasonable," said Don, "but
you can! You watch Hall do it, if you don't believe
me. Maybe you don't actually look two ways
at once, Kirkwell, but you can watch your man and
locate the play at the same time. I suppose it
comes with practice."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to see you do it," replied Kirkwell
aggrievedly.</p>

<p>"Watch Hall do it. He's the best guard around
here. I'm not setting up as an example."</p>

<p>"You talk like it," muttered Kirkwell. But
Merton, who had been a silent audience, stepped
in to Don's support.</p>

<p>"Gilbert's only trying to help us, Ned. Quit
grousing. Come on; time's up."</p>

<p>In spite of mutinous objections Kirkwell
profited by Don's advice and instruction and soon
showed an improvement in his defensive playing.
It didn't appear that day, for Kirkwell was replaced
by Don before the second period was more
than a few minutes old, while Merton gave way to
Goodhugh. Don's advent considerably strengthened
the left of the second team's line and more
than once during his brief presence there he had
the satisfaction of outwitting Tom Hall and once
got clear through and smeared a play well behind
the first team's line.</p>

<p>Boots cut his squad from day to day and on
Friday only some eighteen candidates remained.
Brace went with the discard. Between parting
with Brace and Goodhugh, Don, when consulted,
chose to sacrifice the former. Possibly young
Brace suspected Don's part in his release, for,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
for some time after that, he viewed Don with
scowls.</p>

<p>Don's hand was now entirely healed, although
the scars still showed, and, according to the doctor,
would continue to show for a long time. Mr.
Boutelle used Don at right guard during some
portion of every scrimmage game against the
first, a fact which caused Kirkwell a deal of
anxiety. Kirkwell had from the first, and not unreasonably,
resented Don's appearance with the
second team squad. Don had been, as every fellow
knew, slated for the first team, and Kirkwell
thought it was unfair of him to drop back to the
second and "try to do him out of his place."
Feeling as he did, it isn't surprising that he took
more and more unkindly to Don's teaching. It
took all of Don's good nature at times to prevent
an open break with Kirkwell. Once the latter accused
Don of trying to "ball him up" so that he
would play poorly and Don would get the position.
The next day, though, he made an awkward apology
for that accusation and was quite receptive to
Don's criticisms and instructions. But Don's task
was no easy one and it grew harder as the season
progressed and the second team, especially as to
its linemen, failed to develop the ability Mr.
Boutelle looked for. Don more than once was on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the point of resigning his somewhat thankless
task, but Tim refused to sanction it, and what Tim
said had a good deal of influence with Don.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he said moodily, "I hope Kirkwell
will break something and get out of it."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," remonstrated Tim. "Them's no
Christian sentiments."</p>

<p>"I do, though. Or, anyway, I hope something
will happen to let me out of it. Boots said he was
afraid Robey would take me on the first, but I
don't see any chance of it."</p>

<p>"I don't see why he doesn't, though," mused
Tim. "Your hand's all right now and you're
playing a corking good game. You can work all
around any guard he's got except, maybe, Tom.
Tom's rather a bit above the average, if you ask
me. Neither Walton nor Pryme amounts to a
whole lot."</p>

<p>"Robey's been playing Walton a good deal
lately," said Don. "I wouldn't be surprised if he
put him in ahead of Gafferty before long."</p>

<p>"There isn't a lot to choose between them, I
guess," answered Tim. "Gafferty's no earthly
good on offence. Wait till we run up against Benton
tomorrow. Those huskies will show Gafferty
up finely. And maybe some more of us," Tim
added with a chuckle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;&mdash;" began Don, vaguely, after a
minute.</p>

<p>But Tim interrupted. "Know what I think? I
think Robey means to take you on the first later
and is letting you stay with Boots just so you'll
get fined down and speeded up a bit. You know
you're still a little slow, Donald."</p>

<p>"I am?" Don asked in genuine surprise. "I
didn't know it. How do you mean, slow,
Tim?"</p>

<p>Tim leaned back in his chair and laced his
fingers together behind his head. "Every way,
Donald. I'm telling you this for your own good,
dearie. I thought you realised it, though, or I'd
have said it before. You start slow and you don't
get up steam until the play's about over. If it
wasn't that you're an indecently strong chap we'd
get the jump on you every time. We do, as it is,
only it doesn't do us much good, because you're a
tough chap to move. Now you think it over, Don.
See if you can't ginger up a bit. Bet you anything
that when you do Robey'll have you yanked
off that second team in no time at all!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you told me," said Don, after a moment's
consideration. "I thought I was doing
pretty well this fall. I know well enough it was
being all-fired slow that kept me off the first last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
fall, but I surely thought I'd picked up a whole
lot of speed. I'll have to go back to practising
starts, I guess."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind the kindergarten stuff, old
man. Just put more jump into it. You'll find you
can do it all right, now that you know about it.
Why, I'll bet you'll be performing like a Jack
rabbit before the season's over!"</p>

<p>"Like a jackass, more likely," responded Don
ruefully.</p>

<p>"No, for a jackass, dearie, doesn't take a hint."</p>

<p>"Well, but I don't believe I <i>can</i> play any faster,
Tim. If I could I'd be doing it, wouldn't I? Just
naturally, I mean."</p>

<p>"Never mind the conundrums, Don. You try
it. If you do I'll be willing to guarantee you a
place on the first."</p>

<p>"I guess your guarantee wouldn't cut much
ice," objected Don, with a laugh. Then he sobered
and added: "Funny game, though, me coaching
Kirkwell and Merton and Goodhugh. Looks as if
I was the one needed the coaching."</p>

<p>"Sure. We all need it. No one's perfect, Don,
although, without boasting, I will say that I come
pretty near it."</p>

<p>"You come pretty near being a perfect chump,
if that's what you mean."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Tim shook his head. "It isn't at all what I
mean. Now cut out the artless prattle and let me
find some sense in this history stuff&mdash;if there is
any!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE WIDTH OF A FINGER</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">At</span> chapel the next morning Mr. Fernald, the principal,
after the usual announcements had been
made, lifted a newspaper from the table at his
side and ran his eyes over an item there. "I have
here," he said, "a copy of this week's Brimfield
<i>Times</i>, which tells of an incident of which I
had not learned. In telling of a fire on Saturday
night last which destroyed a barn and
damaged other buildings on the farm of Mr. William
Corrigan, some three miles from the village,
the <i>Times</i> makes mention of the valuable assistance
of a Mr. Grover Brady and four boys of this
school. According to the <i>Times</i>, Mr. Brady and
four boys dashed to the scene in a high-powered
automobile, organised a bucket brigade and
saved"&mdash;Mr. Fernald consulted his authority
again&mdash;"saved the dwelling house from the devouring
element. The metaphor is that of the
paper. Possibly the <i>Times</i> is misinformed with
regard to the heroic young firemen, although I
hope not. I should be very pleased to discover<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that they were really Brimfieldians. If they were,
if they are before me at this moment, I trust they
will signify the fact by standing up. I'm sure we'd
all like to know their identity and give them well-deserved
applause. Now then, will the modest
heroes kindly reveal themselves?"</div>

<p>Silence ensued, a silence broken only by a few
whispers and some shuffling of feet. Every fellow's
eyes searched the room, or, at least, that is
true of almost every fellow. Tim smiled innocently
and expectantly at the principal, Clint
studied the back of the head in front of him most
interestedly, Don observed the scar in his hand
absorbedly and Tom grinned because Steve Edwards
was whispering from the side of his mouth:
"Why don't you get up, you bloomin' hero, why
don't you get up?" Harry Walton was smiling
that knowing smile of his and doing his best to
catch Don's eye. And Don somehow knew it and
didn't dare look toward him.</p>

<p>"I'm disappointed," said Mr. Fernald after a
minute. "Either the paper is mistaken or the
fellows are over-modest. Well, if they won't
speak for themselves perhaps someone else will
volunteer to wrest them from the obscurity they
so evidently court. How about that, boys? Anyone
know who the heroes are?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Again silence for an instant, and then, in various
parts of the room, the sudden moving of seats or
tramping of feet as though someone was about to
get up. But no one did, and some of the younger
boys in front began to titter nervously. Mr. Fernald
smiled and laid the Brimfield <i>Times</i> back on
the table.</p>

<p>"No heroes amongst us, eh? Well, doubtless
if any of you had been there you'd have performed
quite as well as these unknown young gentlemen
did. I like to think so. Dismissed."</p>

<p>"Do you think he suspects us?" asked Tom as
he ranged himself beside Tim on the way out.
"Gee, I thought once he was looking right at
me!"</p>

<p>"That's what it is to have a guilty conscience,"
replied Tim, in a virtuous tone. "Of course he
doesn't suspect. If he did he'd have named us,
sure as shooting. The funny part of it is that he
hasn't thought about what time the fire was!
Maybe the paper didn't say. If he knew that he'd
probably be a sight more anxious to find us!"</p>

<p>"I was scared stiff that Harry Walton would
blab. I didn't dare look at him."</p>

<p>"Harry doesn't know you were with us. He
recognised Don, or says he did, and he naturally
thinks I was along, but he doesn't know who the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
other two were. If he opens his mouth I'll brain
him."</p>

<p>"I guess he won't. He's a sort of a pup, but
he isn't mean enough for that. Gee, but it almost
ruined my appetite for breakfast!"</p>

<p>"Even if Josh did find out," said Tim as they
turned into Wendell, "he wouldn't do much to us,
I guess. It wasn't our fault the fire was late in
getting started, and the paper calls us
heroes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it does. That's some of Josh's
nonsense. I'm going to get a copy of the <i>Times</i>
and see what it does say."</p>

<p>"Take my advice and let the <i>Times</i> alone," advised
Tim. "Why, I wouldn't be seen with a copy
of it in my possession! It would be circumstantial
evidence, or corroborative evidence or something
horrid, and I'd get pinched for sure. You
keep away from the <i>Times</i>, dearie."</p>

<p>There was a good deal of interested speculation
as to the identity of the four youths who had participated
in the rescue of Farmer Corrigan's
dwelling, but the general opinion was to the effect
that the local paper had erred. One fellow made
the suggestion in Don's hearing that if faculty
would look it up and see who had leave of absence
Saturday night they might spot the chaps. Don<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
sincerely hoped the idea wouldn't occur to Mr.
Fernald!</p>

<p>But interest in the matter soon waned, for
Brimfield was to play Benton Military Academy
that afternoon and what sort of a showing she
would make against that very worthy opponent
was a far more absorbing subject for speculation.
Benton had been defeated handily enough last
year, but reports from the military academy this
Fall led Brimfield to expect a hard contest. And
her expectations were fulfilled.</p>

<p>Benton brought at least a hundred neatly uniformed
rooters along and the field took on a very
gallant appearance. The visitors seemed gaily
confident of victory and from the time they
marched into the field and took their places in the
stand until the kick-off there was no cessation of
the songs and cheers from the blue-clad cohorts.
Coach Robey started his best men in that game
and, as was quickly proved, needed to. The first
period was a bitterly contested punting duel in
which Rollins, and, later, St. Clair came off second
best. But the difference in the kicking of the rival
teams was not sufficient to allow of much advantage,
and the first ten-minute set-to ended without
a score. In fact, neither team had been at any
time within scoring distance of the other's goal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
line. When play began again Benton changed
her tactics and started a rushing game that for a
few minutes made headway. But a fumble cost her
the ball and a possible score on the Maroon-and-Grey's
twenty-yard line and the latter adopted
the enemy's plan and banged at the soldiers' line
for fair gains. A forward pass brought the spectators
to their feet and gained twenty-two yards
for Brimfield, Steve Edwards being on the receiving
end of a very pretty play. But Benton stiffened
presently and Brimfield was forced to kick.</p>

<p>That kick spelled disaster for Brimfield. Rollins
dropped back to near his own thirty yards
and sent a remarkable corkscrew punt to Benton's
twenty. It was one of the prettiest punts
ever seen on the Brimfield gridiron, for it was so
long that it went over the quarter-back's head, so
high that it enabled the Maroon-and-Grey ends to
get well down under it and was nicely placed in
the left-hand corner of the field. The Benton
quarter made no effort to touch it while it was
bounding toward the goal line, for with both
Edwards and Holt hovering about him a fumble
might easily have resulted, and it was only when
the pigskin had settled down to a slow, toppling
roll and it was evident that it did not mean to go
over the line that the Benton quarter seized it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
What happened then was little short of a miracle.
Both Captain Edwards and Holt took it for
granted that the quarter-back meant to drop on
the ball and call it down, and, since there was no
necessity to smother the opponent, each waited for
the other to tackle and hold him. But the first
thing anyone knew the Benton quarter had the
ball in his hands, had squirmed somehow between
Edwards and Holt and was speeding up the middle
of the field!</p>

<p>Between him and the fifty-yard line friend and
foe were mingled, and to win through seemed a
preposterous undertaking. And yet first one and
then another of the enemy was passed, team-mates
formed hasty interference for the runner and,
suddenly, to the consternation of the Brimfield
stand, the quarter, with the ball snuggled in the
crook of his left elbow, was out of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, with
a clear field before him and two Benton players
guarding his rear. Crewe made a desperate effort
to get him near the thirty-yard line, but the interference
was too much for him, and after that,
although Brimfield trailed the runner to the goal
line and over, there was no doubt as to the result.
And when the Benton quarter deposited the ball
squarely between the posts and laid himself down
beside it friend and foe alike arose from their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
seats and cheered him long and loudly. Never
had a more spectacular run been made there, for
not only had the quarter practically traversed the
length of the field, but had eluded the entire opposing
eleven.</p>

<p>Benton deserved to secure the odd point by kicking
goal, but goal-kicking was the quarter-back's
business and he was far too tuckered to try, and
so the player who did make the attempt failed miserably,
and Benton had to be satisfied with those
six points. Probably she was, for she cheered
madly and incessantly while the period lasted and
then spent the half-time singing triumphant
paeans. And those military academy chaps could
sing, too! Brimfield, a bit chastened, listened and
applauded generously and only found her own
voice when the Maroon-and-Grey warriors trotted
back again.</p>

<p>Carmine had given place to McPhee at quarter
and Holt to Cheep at right end. Otherwise Brimfield's
line was the same as in the first half. McPhee
opened his bag of tricks soon after play
began and double-passes and delayed-passes and
a certain fake plunge at guard with quarter running
wide outside the drawn-in end made good
gains and took the ball down the field with only
one halt to Benton's twenty-three yards. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the military academy team solved a fake-kick and
St. Clair was laid low behind his line. Rollins
made up the lost distance and a little more besides,
and finally, with the ball on Benton's nineteen
yards on fourth down, Captain Edwards called
for a try-at-goal and Rollins dropped back to the
thirty. Fortunately the Maroon-and-Grey forwards
held back the plunging enemy in good style,
Rollins had all the time he wanted, the pigskin
dropped neatly over the bar, and the score-board
figures proclaimed 6 to 3.</p>

<p>Benton kicked off and once more Brimfield
started up the field, St. Clair, Tim Otis and Rollins
banging the line from end to end and Edwards
varying the monotony by sweeping around behind
and launching himself off on wide runs. But the
advance slackened near the middle of the field
and an attempted forward pass was captured by
Benton. That play brought the ten-minute period
to an end.</p>

<p>Benton tried the Brimfield centre and got
through for four yards, hit it again and made
three and placed the ball on the home team's forty-yard
line. Time was called for Brimfield and
Danny Moore trotted on to administer to Gafferty.
The left guard was soon on his feet again, although
a trifle unsteady, it seemed, and Benton, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
three yards to gain, swung into the other side and
pushed a half-back through for the distance. Carmine
replaced McPhee and Holt went back to end
position. Benton once more thrust at Gafferty
and, although the secondary defence plugged the
hole, went through for two yards. Time was
again called and this time the trainer led Joe Gafferty
off the field, the latter protesting bitterly,
and Harry Walton was hurried in. Benton tried
a forward pass and made it go for a small gain
and then, on third down, got past Thayer and
reached the eighteen before Carmine tipped up
the runner. Across the gridiron, Benton's supporters
yelled mightily and a second touchdown
looked imminent.</p>

<p>Benton fumbled and recovered for a two-yard
loss and then sent that heroic quarter up the field
to try a drop kick. It looked easy enough, for the
ball was near the twenty-eight yards and in front
of the right hand goal post. Captain Edwards implored
his men to block the kick and comparative
quiet fell over the field. Back shot the ball and
the quarter's foot swung at it, but the left side of
the Benton line crumbled and Hall and Crewe
flung themselves into the path of the ball. Four
seconds later it was snuggled under Tim Otis's
chest near the thirty-five yards, for Tim had followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the forwards through and trailed the
bouncing pigskin up the field.</p>

<p>That misadventure seemed to take the heart
out of the visitors, and when Brimfield, with new
courage and determination, smashed at her line
she fell back time and again. Substitutes were
sent in lavishly, but although the right side of the
Benton line stiffened for awhile, the left continued
weak. Coach Robey sent in Compton to replace
Steve Edwards and, later, Howard for St. Clair.
With the best part of five minutes left, Brimfield
hoped to put over a winning touchdown, and the
backs responded gallantly to Carmine's demands.
Near the enemy's forty-yard line Rollins threw a
neat forward to Holt and the latter raced along
the side of the field for a dozen yards before he
was forced over the line. That took the ball to
Benton's twenty-one. Two tries at the line netted
but six yards and Compton took the pigskin on
an end-around play and just made the distance.</p>

<p>Brimfield hammered the enemy's left wing and
reached her five-yard line in three downs, but
Benton, fiercely determined, her feet on the last
line mark, was putting up a strong defence. Tom
Hall, captain pro tem., and Carmine consulted. A
forward pass might succeed, and if it did would
win the game, but Benton would be watching for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
it and neither Holt nor Compton was a brilliant
catcher of thrown balls. A goal from the field
would only tie the score, but it seemed the wisest
play. So Rollins dropped back to the twenty and
stretched his arms. But Benton was sure a forward
was to result and when the ball went back
her attempts to block the kick were not very enthusiastic.
That was fortunate for Brimfield, for
Thursby's pass had been short and Rollins had to
pick the ball from the turf before he could swing
at it. That delay was almost his undoing, since
the Benton forwards were now trickling through,
and it was only by the veriest good fortune that
the ball shot between them from Rollins's toe and,
after showing an inclination to pass to the left of
the goal and changing its mind in mid-air, dropped
over the bar barely inside the post. Brimfield
cheered and the 3 on the board changed to 6.
Coach Robey called Rollins and Tim Otis out, replacing
them with Martin and Gordon. Brimfield
kicked off once more and, with a scant minute and
a half to play, the Maroon-and-Grey tried valiantly
to add another score.</p>

<p>Carmine caught on his twenty and took the ball
to the thirty-six before he was stopped, and Brimfield
cheered wildly and danced about in the stand.
Plugging the line would never cover that distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to the farther goal line and so Carmine sent Gordon
off around the left end. But Gordon couldn't
find the hole and was run down for no gain. A
forward pass, Carmine to Compton, laid the ball
on the forty-eight yards. Howard slid off right
tackle for six and, on a fake-kick play, Martin ran
around left end for seven more. Brimfield
shouted imploringly from the stand and, across
the field, Benton cheered incessantly, doggedly,
longing for the whistle.</p>

<p>The Benton team used all allowable methods to
waste time. The timekeeper hovered nearby, his
eyes darting <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'rom'">from</ins> the galloping hand of his watch
to the players. "Twenty-nine seconds," he responded
to Tom Hall's question. Carmine clapped
his hands impatiently.</p>

<p>"Signals now! Make this good! Left tackle
over! 27&mdash;57&mdash;88&mdash;16! Hep! 27&mdash;57&mdash;88&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The backs swung obliquely to the right, Carmine
dropped from sight, his back to the line, Benton's
left side was borne slowly away, fighting hard, and
confusion reigned. Then Carmine whirled
around, sprang, doubled over, through the scattered
right side of the enemy's line, challenged
only by the end, who made a desperate attempt at
a tackle but failed, and, with only the opposing
quarter between him and the goal line, raced like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the wind. About him was a roaring babel of
sound, voices urging him on, shouts of dismay,
imploring shrieks from behind. Then the quarter
was before him, crouching with out-reached hands,
a strained, anxious look on his dirt-streaked face.</p>

<p>They met near the twenty-yard line. The Benton
quarter launched himself forward. Carmine
swung to the left and leaped. A hand groped at
his ankle, caught, and Carmine fell sprawling to
the turf. But he found his feet like a cat,
wrenched the imprisoned ankle free and went
staggering, stumbling on. Again he fell, on the
five-yard line, and again the Benton quarter dived
for him. But Carmine was not to be stopped with
the line only five short yards away. He wrested
himself to his feet again, the arms of the Benton
quarter squirming about his knees, plunged on a
stride, dragging the enemy with him, found his
legs locked firmly now, struggled desperately and
then flung himself sidewise toward the last white
streak. And as he fell his hands, clasping the ball,
reached forward and a whistle blew.</p>

<p>It was said afterward that a half-inch decided
that touchdown. And the half-inch was on the
wrong side of the line! Carmine wept frankly
when he heard the decision and Tom Hall had to
be held away from the referee, but facts were facts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and Carmine had lost his touchdown and Brimfield
the victory by the width of a finger!</p>

<p>Benton departed joyously, cheering and singing,
and Brimfield tried hard to be satisfied with a
drawn game. But she wasn't very successful, and
for the next few days the referee's decision was
discussed and derided and regretted.</p>

<p>What sorrow Don felt was largely mitigated
when, after supper that evening, Steve Edwards
found him in front of Billings. "You come to us
Monday, Don," said the captain. "Robey told me
to tell you. Joe Gafferty's got a rib caved in and
is out of it for a fortnight at least. Get Tim to
coach you up on the signals. Don't forget."</p>

<p>As though he was likely to!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>TIM EXULTS AND EXPLAINS</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">When</span> Don told Tim the latter insisted on performing
a triumphal dance about the room to the
tune of "Boola." When Don squirmed himself
loose Tim continued alone until the droplight was
knocked to the floor at the cost of one green shade.
Then he threw himself, panting but jubilant, on his
bed and hilariously kicked his feet in air. Don
observed him with a faint smile.</div>

<p>"You wooden Indian, you!" exclaimed Tim,
sitting up and dropping his feet to the floor with
a crash. "There you stand like a&mdash;a graven image,
looking as though you'd just received an invitation
to a funeral! Cheer, you idiot! Make a
noise! Aren't you tickled to death?"</p>

<p>"You bet I am!" replied Don.</p>

<p>"Well, do something, then! You ought to have
a little of my Latin temperament, Don. You'd be
a heap easier to live with. If it was I who had
just been waited on humbly by the first team captain
and invited to join the eleven I'd&mdash;I'd make
a&mdash;a noise!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think you've been doing?"
laughed Don. "You'll have Horace in here in a
minute. Steve says you're to coach me on the
signals."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow!" Tim waved his hand. "Time
enough for that, Don. Just now it behooves us to
celebrate."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Don.</p>

<p>Tim thought long and earnestly. Finally,
"Let's borrow Larry Jones's accordion and serenade
Josh!" he said.</p>

<p>"Let's not. And let's not go to a fire, either!
Think of something better, Timmy."</p>

<p>"Then we'll go out and bay at the moon.
I've got to do something! By the time
Joe's got his busted rib mended you'll have
that left guard position nailed to the planks,
Don."</p>

<p>"How about Walton?" asked Don dubiously.</p>

<p>"A fig for Walton! Two figs for him! A whole
box of figs! All you've got to do is speed up a bit
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suppose I can't?"</p>

<p>"Suppose nothing! You've <i>got</i> to! If you
don't you'll have me to fight, Donald. If you don't
cinch that position in just one week I&mdash;I'll take
you over my knee and spank you with a belt!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Come on over to Clint's room. Let us disseminate
the glorious tidings. Let us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd rather learn the signals," said Don.
"There's only tonight and tomorrow, you know."</p>

<p>Tim appealed despairingly to the ceiling with
wide-spread hands. "There's no poetry in his
soul," he mourned, "no blood in his veins!" He
faced Don scornfully. "Donald P. Gilbert is your
name, my son, and the P stands for Practical. All
right, then, draw up a chair and let's have it over.
To think, though, that I should have to sit indoors
a night like this and teach signals to a wooden-head!
I wooden do it for anyone else. Ha!
How's that! Get a pad and a pencil and try to
look intelligent."</p>

<p>"All right? Mark 'em down, then. Starting at
the left, number your holes 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 6, 4, 2. Got
that? Number your left end 1, the next man 3,
the next 5. Omit centre. Right guard 6, right
tackle 4, right end 2. Now, your backfield. Quarter
0, left half 7, right half 8, full-back 9."</p>

<p>"Gee, that's hard to remember," murmured
Don.</p>

<p>"And hard to guess," answered Tim. "Now,
your first number, unless it's under thirty, is a
fake. If it's under thirty it means that the next
number is the number of a play. Over thirty, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
means nothing. Your second digit of your second
number is your runner. The second digit of the
third number is the hole. The fourth number, as
you doubtless surmise, is also a fake. Now, then,
sir! 65&mdash;47&mdash;23&mdash;98! What is it?"</p>

<p>"Left half between end and tackle."</p>

<p>"On the left. Correct. 19&mdash;87&mdash;77&mdash;29?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Nineteen calls for a numbered
play."</p>

<p>"Right again, Mr. Gilbert, your performance is
startling! The pity of it is, though, that about
the time you get these signals pat Robey'll change
them for the Claflin game. So far we've only got
eight numbered plays, and they aren't complicated.
Want to go into them tonight?"</p>

<p>"No, I guess not. I'd rather get these holes
and players sort of fixed in my mind first. We'll
go over the plays tomorrow, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"It will break my heart, but I'll do it for you.
Now will you come over to Clint's?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not, Tim. You go. I want to mull
over these signals."</p>

<p>Presently, having exhausted his vocabulary on
his room-mate, Tim went. Don settled his head
in his hands and studied the numbered diagram
for the better part of an hour. Don was slow at
memorising, but what was once forced into his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
mind stayed there. A little before ten o'clock he
slipped the diagram under a box in a bureau
drawer and went to bed with a calm mind, and
when Tim returned riotously a few minutes later
Don was sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p>On Monday, in chapel, Don and the "heroes" of
Farmer Corrigan's conflagration had another
shock, and Don, for one, wondered when he was
to hear the last of that affair. "Since last week,"
said Mr. Fernald drily, "when I requested the
four boys who helped to put out a fire at the Corrigan
farm to make themselves known to an admiring
public, I have gained an understanding of
their evident desire to conceal their identities. I
am forced to the conclusion that it was not altogether
modesty that kept them silent. The fire, it
appears, did not break out until nearly half-past
nine. Consequently the young gentlemen were
engaged in their heroic endeavours at a time when
they should have been in their dormitories. I have
not yet found out who they were, but I am making
earnest efforts to do so. Meanwhile, if they wish
to lighten the consequences of their breach of
school regulations, I'd earnestly advise them to
call and see me. I may add that, in view of the
unusual circumstances, had they made a clean
breast of the affair I should have dealt very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
leniently with them. That is all, I think. Dismissed."</p>

<p>None of the culprits dared to so much as glance
at the others on the way out of the hall, but afterward,
when breakfast was over, they gathered
anxiously together in Number 6 Billings and discussed
the latest development with lowered voices,
like a quartette of anarchists arranging a bomb
party.</p>

<p>"He's right up on his ear," said Clint gloomily.
"If he gets us now he will send us all packing,
and don't you doubt it!"</p>

<p>"Piffle!" This from Tim, the least impressed
of the four. "Probation is all we'd get. Didn't
the paper say we were heroes?"</p>

<p>"No, it didn't," answered Tom shortly. "And
I wish that paper was in Halifax!"</p>

<p>"Might as well be fired as put on pro," said
Clint. "It would mean no more football this year
for any of us. My word, wouldn't Robey be
mad!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I be!" growled Tom. "Look here,
do you really suppose he's trying to find out who
we were, or was that just a bluff to scare us into
'fessing up!"</p>

<p>"Josh isn't much of a bluffer," observed Don
judiciously. "What he says he means. What I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
don't savvy is why he hasn't found out already.
Every hall master has a record of leaves."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it was Saturday night and I'll bet
half the school had leave," said Tim. "I dare
say, though, that if any fellows are suspected
we're amongst 'em, Don. Being on the first floor,
Josh knows we could sneak in easily. Still, he
can't prove it on us."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," replied Don thoughtfully.
"Suppose he asked Mr. Brady?"</p>

<p>A dismayed silence ensued until Tom laughed
mirthlessly.</p>

<p>"That's one on us," he said. "We never
thought of that. Maybe he has asked Brady
already."</p>

<p>"Brady doesn't know our names," said Tim.
"You didn't tell him, did you, Don?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't ask. But he could easily describe
us so that Josh would recognise us, I
guess."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble with being so plaguy distinguished
looking," mourned Tim. "Seems to
me, fellows, that there's just one thing to be did,
and did sudden."</p>

<p>"You mean warn Mr. Brady?" asked Clint.</p>

<p>"Exactly, my discerning young friend. Maybe
the horse is stolen&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"What horse?" asked Tom perplexedly.</p>

<p>"Merely a figure of speech, Tom. I was about
to observe when so rudely interrupted&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, cut out the verbiage," growled Tom.</p>

<p>"That possibly it was too late to lock the stable
door," continued Tim, "but we'd better do it,
just the same. Let's see if he has a telephone."</p>

<p>"Of course he has," said Clint, "but I don't
think it would be safe to call him up. We'd better
see him. Or write him a letter."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't get a letter until tomorrow,
maybe," objected Don. "One of us had better
beat it over to his place as soon as possible and
ask him to keep mum."</p>

<p>"I can't go," said Tom. "I've got four recits
this morning and Robey would never let me off
practice."</p>

<p>"I don't believe any of us will do much work
this afternoon," said Tim. "I'll go if Robey'll
let me cut. I wish someone would come along,
though. It's a dickens of a trip to make alone.
You come, Clint."</p>

<p>"I will if I can. We'll ask Robey at dinner.
What shall we say to this Brady man?"</p>

<p>"Just tell him what's doing and ask him to forget
what we looked like if Josh writes to him or
calls him up or anything. Brady's a good old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
scout, I'll bet," added Tim with conviction.
"Maybe we'd better buy a setting of eggs to get
on the good side of him."</p>

<p>"Don't be a chump," begged Tim. "I don't
call this a comedy situation, if you do, Tim. I'd
certainly hate to get on pro and have to drop
football!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a chump," begged Tom. "I don't
say it's a comedy, but there's no use weeping, is
there? What's done is done, and we've got to
make the best of it, and a laugh never hurt anyone
yet."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let's make the best of it," answered
Tom peevishly. "Talking doesn't do any
good."</p>

<p>"Neither does grouching," said Tim sweetly.
"You leave it all to Clint and me, Tom. We're a
swell pair of fixers. If we can get to Brady before
Josh does we're all right. And it's a safe wager
Josh hasn't asked Brady yet, for if he had he'd
be on to us. There's the nine o'clock bell, fellows,
and I've got a recit. See you later. Hope for
the best, Tom, and fear the worst!"</p>

<p>Tim seized his books and dashed out, followed
more leisurely by Clint. Tom remained a few minutes
longer and then he, too, took his departure,
still filled with forebodings. Don, left to himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
drew a chair to the table and began to study.
Truth, however, compels me to state that what he
studied was not his German, although he had a
recitation coming in forty minutes, but two sheets
of buff paper torn from a scratch-pad and filled
with writing interspersed with numerals and
adorned with strange diagrams, in short, Tim's
elucidation of the eight numbered plays which up
to the present comprised Brimfield's budget of
tricks. It can't be said that Don covered himself
with glory in Mr. Daley's German class that morning
or that the instructor was at all satisfied, but
Don had the secret satisfaction of knowing that
stored away in the back of his brain was a very
thorough knowledge of the Brimfield football signal
code and of Mr. Robey's special plays.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>MR. BRADY FORGETS</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">That</span> afternoon Don's knowledge stood him in
good stead, for with more than half the first-string
players excused from practice, his services were
called on at the start, and, with McPhee and Cotter
running the squad, the signal drill was long
and thorough. Harry Walton viewed Don's advent
with disfavour. That was apparent to Don
and anyone else who thought of the matter,
although he pretended a good-natured indifference
that wasn't at all deceiving. Don more than
once caught his rival observing him with resentment
and dislike, and, remembering that Harry
Walton had been a witness of his unconventional
return to hall that night, he experienced misgivings.
Of course, Harry wouldn't "peach," but&mdash;well,
Don again wished anyone rather than Harry
had stumbled on the secret.</div>

<p>But he didn't have much time for worrying
about that matter, for Coach Robey went after
them hard that day. In the practice game with
the second team Don started at left guard and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
played the position until within a few minutes of
the whistle. Then Harry Walton, who had been <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'disgruntedly'">disgruntledly</ins>
adorning the bench, took his place. He
didn't look at Don as he accepted the latter's
head-guard, but Don was well aware that Harry
felt anything but good-will for him. Naturally
enough, Harry had, Don reflected, expected to step
into Gafferty's place without opposition when
news of the extent of the latter's injury had become
known, and it was undoubtedly a big disappointment
to him to discover that he had to fight
a new opponent. Don could sympathise with
Harry, for he had endured disappointments himself
during his brief football career, but it is difficult
to sympathise very enthusiastically when the
subject of your sympathy shows his dislike for
you, and Don metaphorically shrugged his shoulders
as he trotted up to the gymnasium.</p>

<p>"It isn't my fault," he said to himself. "I
didn't bust Joe Gafferty's rib and I'm not responsible
for Robey's taking me on the first team.
Walton will just have to make the best of it."</p>

<p>Don couldn't flatter himself that he had played
that afternoon with especial brilliancy, although
he had managed to hold his end up fairly well.
The fact was that he had been so intent on getting
speeded into his performance that he had rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
skimped the niceties of line-play. And he wasn't
at all certain that he had shown any more speed
than usual, either. He awaited Mr. Robey's appearance
in the locker-room with some apprehension,
certain that if he had erred badly he would
soon learn of it. When the coach did arrive at the
tail of the procession of panting players and said
his say without once singling out Don for special
attention, the latter was relieved. He couldn't, he
told himself, have done so very badly, after all!</p>

<p>Tom walked back to Billings with Don to learn
the result of Tim's and Clint's embassy to the
Cedar Ridge Poultry Farm, for the two had obtained
leave of absence from Mr. Robey and had
set forth on their journey the minute a three
o'clock recitation was finished. Tim wasn't in
Number 6 when they reached it, but he and Clint
tramped in soon after, dusty and weary but evidently
triumphant. Tim narrated their experiences.</p>

<p>"Missed the three-fifty car, just as I told Clint
we would if he didn't hustle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had to find a cap to wear, didn't I?" interpolated
Clint.</p>

<p>"Well, we found the place all right, fellows, and,
say, it's some poultry farm, believe me, dearies!
Isn't it corking, Clint?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Clint grunted assent, stretching tired legs across
the floor.</p>

<p>"There's about a thousand acres of it, I guess,
and a mile of red chicken houses and runs, or
whatever you call 'em. How many hens and
things did he tell us he had, Clint?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen hundred, I think. Maybe it was
eighteen thousand. I don't remember. All I
know is there were chickens as far as you could
see, and then some."</p>

<p>"Never mind the descriptive matter," urged
Tom. "What did he say? Had Josh been at him?
Did he promise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that, dearie. When we found
him he was doing something to that car of his in
a cute little garage. And, say, it's an eight-cylinder
Lothrop, and a regular jim-dandy! Well, he
took us into his house first&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom groaned in despair.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;And fed us on crackers and cake and ginger
ale. Say, he's got a peach of a bungalow there;
small but entire; and a cute little Jap who cooks
and looks after things for him. Well, then he
took us out and showed us around the place.
Chickens! Gee, I didn't know there were so many
in the world! And we saw the incubators and the&mdash;what
you call them&mdash;brooders, and&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"For the love of mud!" exclaimed Tom.
"Can't you get down to dots? <i>Is it all right or
isn't it?</i>"</p>

<p>Tim smiled exasperatingly. "Then he showed
us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom arose to his feet and took a step toward
him.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Tim hurriedly. "Everything,
Thomas! We told him what was up and
how we didn't want Josh to find out it was us
who attended Mr. Corrigan's fire party and
asked him if he would please not remember
what we looked like if Josh asked him. And he
said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He laughed," interrupted Clint, and chuckled
himself.</p>

<p>"That's right! He laughed a lot. 'You're a
little bit late,' he said. 'Mr. Fernald called me up
by telephone nearly a week ago, fellows, and
wanted to know all about it.' 'You didn't tell
him?' I yelped. 'No, I couldn't,' he said. 'You
see, you hadn't told me your names, and it was
pretty dark that night and somehow or other I just
couldn't seem to recall what you looked like! Mr.
Fernald sounded considerably disappointed and
like he didn't quite believe me, but that can't be
helped.' Say, fellows, I wanted to hug him! Or&mdash;or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
buy an egg or something! Honest, I did!
He's all right, what?"</p>

<p>"He's a corker!" said Tom, sighing with relief.
"You don't suppose Corrigan or any of the others
there that night would remember us, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not likely. Mr. Brady didn't think so, anyway."</p>

<p>"Then it's all to the merry!" cried Tom. "Gee,
but that's a load off my mind!"</p>

<p>"Off your what?" asked Tim curiously.</p>

<p>"It's all right if Harry Walton keeps quiet,"
said Don. "If he gets to talking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If he does I'll beat him up," said Tim earnestly.
"But he won't. He wouldn't be such a
snip, in the first place, and he wouldn't dare to in
the second."</p>

<p>"N-no, I guess not," agreed Don. But his tone
didn't hold much conviction. "Only, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you fellows one thing," announced
Tom vehemently.</p>

<p>"Don't strain yourself," advised Tim.</p>

<p>"And that," continued the other, scowling at
the interruption, "is that no one gets me into any
more scrapes until after the Claflin game!"</p>

<p>"Gee, to hear you talk," exclaimed Tim indignantly,
"anyone would think we'd tied you up
with a rope and forcibly abducted you! Who's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
idea was it, anyway, to go to the village that
night?"</p>

<p>"Yours, if you want to know! I don't say I
didn't go along willingly enough, Tim. What I
do say is&mdash;<i>never again!</i> Anyway," he added,
"not until football's over!"</p>

<p>Morgan's School, which had defeated Brimfield
the year before, 6 to 3, came and departed. Brimfield
took the visitor's measure this time, and,
although she only scored one touchdown and failed
to kick goal, the contest was far less close and interesting
than the score would suggest. Brimfield
played the opponents to a standstill in the
first half and scored just before the end of it. In
the third quarter Coach Robey began substituting
and when the last ten minutes started the Maroon-and-Grey
had only three first-string fellows in her
line-up. The substitutes played good football and,
while not able to push the pigskin across Morgan's
line, twice reached her fifteen yards and twice
tried and narrowly missed a goal from the field.</p>

<p>On the whole it could not be said that Brimfield's
performance that blustery Saturday afternoon
was impressive, for she was frequently
caught napping on the defensive, showed periods
of apathy and did more fumbling, none of which
resulted disastrously, than she should have. Tim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Otis had a remarkably good day and was undeniably
the best man in the backfield for the home
team. Carmine played a heady, snappy game, and
Don, who played the most of three quarters at left
guard, conducted himself very well. Don's work
was never of the spectacular sort, but at his best
he was a steady and thoroughly reliable lineman
and very effective on defence. He was still slow
in getting into plays, a fact which made him of less
value than Joe Gafferty on attack. Even Harry
Walton showed up better than Don when Brimfield
had the ball. But neither Gafferty nor Walton
was as strong on defence as Don.</p>

<p>Walton had been very earnestly striving all the
week to capture the guard position, but the fact
that Don had been played through most of
the Morgan's game indicated that the latter
was as yet a slight favourite in Coach Robey's
estimation. During the week succeeding the
Morgan's game the two rivals kept at it
nip and tuck, and their team-mates looked on
with interest. At practice Mr. Robey showed no
favour to either, and each came in for his full
share of criticism, but when, the next Saturday,
the team journeyed away from home and played
Cherry Valley, it was again Don who started the
game between Thayer and Thursby and who remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in the line-up until the fourth period, by
which time Brimfield had piled up the very satisfactory
score of twenty-six points. In the final
five minutes Cherry Valley managed to fool the
visitors and get a forward pass off for a gain
that placed the ball on Brimfield's fourteen
yards, and from there her drop-kicker put the
pigskin over the cross-bar and tallied three points.
The game was uninteresting unless one was a partisan,
and even then there were few thrills. Brimfield
played considerably better than in the Morgan's
game and emerged with no more important
damages than a wrenched ankle, which fell to the
share of Martin, who had taken Rollins's place in
the last period.</p>

<p>Joe Gafferty came back to practice the following
Monday, but was missing again a day or two
later, and the school heard with some dismay
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'that's'">that</ins> Joe's parents had written to Mr. Fernald
and forbidden Joe to play any more football that
year. Joe was inconsolable and went around for
the next week or so looking like a lost soul. After
that he accepted the situation and helped Mr.
Boutelle coach the second. That second had by
that time been shaken together into a very capable
and smooth-running team, a team which was giving
the first more and more trouble every day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Coach Robey had again levied on it for a player,
taking Merton to the first when Gafferty was lost
to him, and again Mr. Boutelle growled and protested
and, finally, philosophically shrugged his
shoulders. A week later Merton was released to
the second once more and Pryme, who had been
playing at right guard as a substitute for Tom
Hall, was tried out on the other side of centre with
good results. Pryme's advent as a contender for
the left guard position complicated the battle between
Don and Harry Walton, and until after the
Southby game the trio of candidates indulged in
a three-cornered struggle that was quite pretty to
watch.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Don, that struggle for
supremacy threatened to affect his class standing,
for it occupied so much of his thought that there
was little left for study. When, however, the
office dropped a hint and Mr. Daley presented an
ultimatum, Don realised that he was taking football
far too seriously, and, being a rather level-headed
youth, he mended his ways. He expected,
as a result, to find himself left behind in the race
with Walton and Pryme, but, oddly enough, his
game was in no degree affected so far as he could
determine. In fact, within a few days the situation
was simplified by the practical elimination of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Pryme as a contender. This happened when, just
before the Southby game, Tom Hall, together with
eight other members of Mr. Moller's physics class
went on probation, and Pryme was needed at right
guard.</p>

<p>I have mentioned Tom's probation very casually,
quite as if it was a matter of slight importance,
but you may be sure that the school viewed
it in no such way. Coming as it did little more
than a fortnight before the big game, it was looked
on as a dire catastrophe, no more and no less; and
the school, which had laughed and chuckled over
the incident which had caused the catastrophe,
and applauded the participants in it, promptly
turned their thumbs down when the effect became
known and indignantly dubbed the affair "silly
kid's play" and blamed Tom very heartily. How
much of the blame he really deserved you shall
judge for yourself, but the affair merits a chapter
of its own.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE JOKE ON MR. MOLLER</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Amy Byrd</span> started it.</div>

<p>Or, perhaps, in the last analysis, Mr. Moller
began it himself. Mr. Moller's first name was
Caleb, a fact which the school was quick to seize
on. At first he was just "Caleb," then "Caleb the
Conqueror," and, finally, "The Conqueror."
The "Conqueror" part of it was added in recognition
of Mr. Moller's habit of attiring himself for
the class room as for an afternoon tea. He was a
new member of the faculty that fall and Brimfield
required more than the few weeks which had
elapsed since his advent to grow accustomed to his
grandeur of apparel. Mr. Caleb Moller was a
good-looking, in fact quite a handsome young man
of twenty-five or six, well-built, tall and the proud
possessor of a carefully trimmed moustache and
Vandyke beard, the latter probably cultivated in
the endeavour to add to his apparent age. He
affected light grey trousers, fancy waistcoats of
inoffensive shades, a frock coat, grey gaiters and
patent leather shoes. His scarf was always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
pierced with a small black pearl pin. There's no
denying that Mr. Moller knew how to dress or
that the effect was pleasing. But Brimfield wasn't
educated to such magnificence and Brimfield
gasped loudly the first time Mr. Moller burst on
its sight. Afterward it laughed until the novelty
began to wear off. Mr. Moller was a capable
instructor and a likeable man, although it took
Brimfield all of the first term to discover the latter
fact owing to the master's dignified aloofness.
Being but a scant eight years the senior of some
of his pupils, he perhaps felt it necessary to emphasise
his dignity a little. By the last of October,
however, the school had accepted Mr. Moller and
was, possibly, secretly a little proud to have for a
member of its faculty one who possessed such
excellent taste in the matter of attire. He was
universally voted "a swell dresser," and not a
few of the older fellows set themselves to a modest
emulation of his style. There remained, however,
many unregenerate youths who continued to
poke fun at "The Conqueror," and of these was
Amy Byrd.</p>

<p>It isn't beyond the bounds of reason that jealousy
may have had something to do with Amy's
attitude, for Amy was "a swell dresser" himself
and had a fine eye for effects of colour. Amy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
combinations of lavender or dull rose or pearl-grey
shirts, socks and ties were recognised masterpieces
of sartorial achievement. The trouble with
Amy was that when the tennis season was over
he had nothing to interest himself in aside from
maintaining a fairly satisfactory standing in class,
and I'm sorry to say that Amy didn't find the
latter undertaking wildly exciting. He was, therefore,
an excellent subject for the mischief microbe,
and the mischief microbe had long since discovered
the fact. Usually Amy's escapades were
harmless enough; for that matter, the present one
was never intended to lead to any such unfortunate
results as actually attended it; and in justice
to Amy it should be distinctly stated that he
would never have gone into the affair had he foreseen
the end of it. But he couldn't see any further
into the future than you or I, and so&mdash;yes, on the
whole, I think it may be fairly said that Amy
Byrd started it.</p>

<p>It was on a Tuesday, what time Amy should
have been deep in study, that Clint Thayer, across
the table, had his attention wrested from his book
by the sound of deep, mirthful chuckles. He
glanced over questioningly. Amy continued to
chuckle until, being bidden to share the joke or
shut up, he took Clint into his confidence. Clint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
was forced to chuckle some himself when he had
heard Amy through, but the chuckles were followed
by earnest efforts to dissuade his friend
from his proposed scheme.</p>

<p>"He won't stand for it, Amy," Clint protested.
"He will report the lot of you to Josh and you'll
be in a peck of trouble. It would be terribly funny,
all right, but you'd better not try it."</p>

<p>"Funny! My friend, it would be excruciating!
And I certainly am going to have a stab at it.
Let's see who will go into it. Steve Edwards&mdash;no,
Steve wouldn't, of course. Tom Hall will, I'll
bet. And Roy Draper and Harry Wescott, probably.
We ought to get as many of the fellows as
we can. I wish you were in that class, Clint."</p>

<p>"I don't. You're a chump to try such a trick,
Amy. You'll get pro for sure. Maybe worse. I
don't believe Moller can take a joke; he's too
haughty."</p>

<p>"Oh, rot! He will take it all right. Anyway,
what kick can he have? We fellows have just as
much right to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll wish you hadn't," said Clint. "See if
you don't!"</p>

<p>Clint's prophecy proved true, and Amy did wish
he hadn't, but that was some days later, and just
now he was far too absorbed in planning his little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
joke to trouble himself about what might happen
as a result. As soon as study hour was over he
departed precipitately from Number 14. Torrence
and Clint saw no more of him until bedtime. Then
his questions met only with more chuckles and
evasion.</p>

<p>The result did not appear until two days later,
which brings our tale to the forenoon of that unlucky
Thursday preceeding the Southby contest.
Mr. Moller's class in Physics 2 met at eleven
o'clock that morning. Physics was an elective
course with the Fifth Form and a popular one,
many of the fellows taking it only to fill out their
necessary eighteen hours a week. Mr. Moller, attired
as usual with artistic nicety, sat in his swivel
chair, facing the windows, and drummed softly on
the top of the desk with immaculate finger-tips
and waited for the class to assemble.</p>

<p>Had he been observing the arriving students instead
of the tree-tops outside he might have
noticed the peculiar fact that this morning, as
though by common consent, the students were
avoiding the first two rows of seats nearest the
platform. But he didn't notice it. In fact, he
didn't turn his head until the gong in the lower
hall struck and, simultaneously, there sounded in
the room the carefully-timed tread of many feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Then "The Conqueror" swung around in his
chair, felt for the black ribbon which held his tortoise
shell glasses and, in the act of lifting the
glasses to his well-shaped nose, paused and stared.</p>

<p>Down the side aisle of the room, keeping step,
grave of mien, walked nine boys led by the sober-countenanced
Amy Byrd. Each was attired in as
near an approach to Mr. Moller's style as had been
possible with the wardrobes at command. Not all&mdash;in
fact, only two&mdash;wore frock coats, and not all
had been able to supply themselves with light grey
trousers, but the substitutions were very effective,
and in no case was a fancy waistcoat wanting.
Wing collars encircled every throat, grey silk
scarves were tied with careful precision, stick-pins
were at the proper careless tilt, spats, some
grey, some tan, some black, covered each ankle, a
handkerchief protruded a virgin corner from
every right sleeve and over every vest dangled a
black silk ribbon. That only a few of them ended
in glasses was merely because the supply of those
aids to vision had proved inadequate to the demand.
Soberly and amidst an appalling silence
the nine exquisites paced to the front of the room
and disposed themselves in the first two rows.</p>

<p>Mr. Moller, his face extremely red, watched
without word or motion. The rest of the class,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
their countenances too showing an unnatural ruddiness,
likewise maintained silence and immobility
until the last of the nine had shuffled his feet into
place. Then there burst upon the stillness a snigger
which, faint as it was, sounded <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'startingly'">startlingly</ins> loud.
Whereupon pent up emotions broke loose and
a burst of laughter went up that shook the
windows.</p>

<p>It seemed for a minute that that laughter would
never stop. Fellows rolled in their seats and beat
futilely on the arms of their chairs, gasping for
breath and sobriety. And through it all Mr.
Moller stared in a sort of dazed amazement. And
then, when the laughter had somewhat abated, he
arose, one hand on the desk and the other agitatedly
fingering his black ribbon, and the colour
poured out of his cheeks, leaving them strangely
pallid. And Amy, furtively studying him, knew
that Clint had been right, that Mr. Moller couldn't
take a joke, or, in any event, had no intention of
taking this one. Amy wasn't frightened for himself,
in fact he wasn't frightened at all, but he did
experience a twinge of regret for the others whom
he had led into the affair. Then Mr. Moller was
speaking and Amy forgot regrets and listened.</p>

<p>"I am going to give you young gentlemen"&mdash;was
it imagination on Amy's part or had the instructor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
placed the least bit of emphasis on the
last word&mdash;"two minutes more in which to recover
from your merriment. At the end of that time I
shall expect you to be quiet and orderly and ready
to begin this recitation." He drew his watch from
his pocket and laid it on the desk. "So that you
may enjoy this&mdash;this brilliant jest to the full, I'll
ask the nine young gentleman in the front rows
to stand up and face you. If you please, Hall,
Stearns, Draper, Fanning, Byrd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was several seconds before this request was
responded to. Then Amy arose and, one by one,
the others followed and faced the room. Amy
managed to retain his expression of calm innocence,
but the others were ill at ease and many
faces looked very sheepish.</p>

<p>"Now, then," announced Mr. Moller quietly.
"Begin, please. You have two minutes."</p>

<p>A dismal silence ensued, a silence broken at intervals
by a nervous cough or the embarrassed
shuffling of feet. Mr. Moller calmly divided his
attention between the class and the watch. Surely
never had one hundred and twenty seconds ticked
themselves away so slowly. There was a noticeable
disinclination on the part of the students to
meet the gaze of the instructor, nor did they seem
any more eager to view the various and generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
painful emotions expressed on the countenances
of the nine. At last Mr. Moller took up his watch
and returned it with its dangling fob to his pocket,
and as he did so some thirty sighs of relief
sounded in the stillness.</p>

<p>"Time's up," announced the instructor. "Be
seated, young gentlemen. Thank you very much."
The nine sank gratefully into their chairs. "I am
sure that we have all enjoyed your joke vastly.
You must pardon me if, just at first, I seemed to
miss the humour of it. I can assure you that I
am now quite&mdash;quite <i>sympathique</i>. We are told
that imitation is the sincerest flattery, and I accept
the compliment in the spirit in which you have
tendered it. Again I thank you."</p>

<p>Mr. Moller bowed gravely and sat down.</p>

<p>Glances, furtive and incredulous, passed from
boy to boy. Amy heaved a sigh of relief. After
all, then, Mr. Moller could take a joke! And for
the first time since the inception of the brilliant
idea Amy felt an emotion very much like regret!
And then the recitation began.</p>

<p>That would have ended the episode had not
Chance taken a hand in affairs. Mr. Fernald very
seldom visited a class room during recitations.
One could count such occurrences on one hand and
the result would have sufficed for the school year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
And yet today, for some reason never apparent
to the boys, Mr. Fernald happened in.</p>

<p>Harry Westcott was holding forth when the
principal's tread caught his attention. Westcott
turned his head, saw and instantly stopped.</p>

<p>"Proceed, Westcott," said Mr. Fernald.</p>

<p>Westcott continued, stammeringly and much at
random. Mr. Fernald quietly walked up the aisle
to the platform. Mr. Moller arose and for a moment
the two spoke in low tones. Then the principal
nodded, smiled and turned to retrace his
steps. As he did so his smiling regard fell upon
the occupants of the two front rows. A look of
puzzlement banished the smile. Bewilderment
followed that. Westcott faltered and stopped
altogether. A horrible silence ensued. Then Mr.
Fernald turned an inquiring look upon the instructor.</p>

<p>"May I ask," he said coldly, "what this&mdash;this
quaint exhibition is intended to convey?"</p>

<p>Mr. Moller hesitated an instant. Then: "I
think I can explain it better, sir, later on," he
replied.</p>

<p>Mr. Fernald bowed, again swept the offenders
with a glance of withering contempt and took his
departure. Mr. Moller looked troubledly after
him before he turned to Westcott and said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
kindly: "Now, Westcott, we will go on, if you
please."</p>

<p>What passed between principal and instructor
later that day was not known, but the result of the
interview appeared the next morning when Mr.
Fernald announced in chapel that because they
had seen fit to publicly insult a member of the
faculty he considered it only just to publicly inform
the following students that they were placed
on probation until further notice. Then followed
the names of Hall, Westcott, Byrd, Draper and
five others. Mr. Fernald added that but for the
intercession of the faculty member whom they had
so vilely affronted the punishment would have
been far heavier.</p>

<p>Nine very depressed youths took their departure
from chapel that morning. To Tom Hall, since
the edict meant that he could not play any more
football that season, unless, which was scarcely
probable, faculty relented within a week or so, the
blow was far heavier than to any of the others.
Being on probation was never a state to be sought
for, but when one was in his last year at school
and had looked forward to ending his football
career in a blaze of glory, probation was just
about as bad as being expelled. In fact, for a day
or two Tom almost wished that Mr. Fernald had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
selected the latter punishment. What made things
harder to bear was the attitude of coaches and
players and the school at large. After the first
shock of surprise and dismay, they had agreed
with remarkable unanimity that Tom had not only
played the fool, but had proved himself a traitor,
and they didn't fail to let Tom know their verdict.
For several days he was as nearly ostracised as it
was possible to be, and those days were very unhappy
ones for him.</p>

<p>Of course Tom was not utterly deserted. Steve
Edwards stood by him firmly, fought public opinion,
narrowly escaped a pitched battle with the
president of the Sixth Form, worried Coach
Robey to death with his demands that that gentler
man intercede for Tom at the office and tried his
best all the time to keep Tom's spirits up. Clint
and Don and Tim and a few others remained
steadfast, as did Amy, who, blaming himself bitterly
for Tom's fix, had done everything he could
do to atone. Following that edict in chapel, Amy
had sought audience with Mr. Fernald and begged
clemency for the others.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," Amy had pleaded earnestly, "I
was the one who started it. The others would
never have gone into it if I hadn't just simply
made them. Why&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Fernald smiled faintly. "You're trying to
convince me, Byrd, that boys like Draper and Hall
and Stearns and Westcott are so weak-willed that
they allowed you to drag them into this thing
against their better judgment and inclinations?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! At least&mdash;perhaps not exactly that,
Mr. Fernald, but I&mdash;I nagged them and dared
them, you see, sir, and they didn't like to be dared
and they just did it to shut me up."</p>

<p>"It's decent of you, Byrd, to try to assume all
the blame, but your story doesn't carry conviction.
Even if it did, I should be sorely tempted to
let the verdict stand, for I should consider boys
who were so easily dragged into mischief badly in
need of discipline. I do wish you'd tell me one
thing, Byrd. How could a fellow, a manly, decent
fellow like you, think up such a caddish trick?
Wounding another man's feelings, Byrd, isn't
really funny, if you stop to consider it."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to hurt Mr. Moller's feelings,
sir," replied Amy earnestly. "We&mdash;I thought it
would just be a&mdash;a sort of a good joke to dress like
him, sir, and&mdash;and get a laugh from the class.
I'm sorry. I guess it was a pretty rotten thing to
do, sir. Only I didn't think about it that way."</p>

<p>"I believe that. Since you've been here, Byrd,
you've been into more or less mischief, but I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
never known you to be guilty before of anything
in such utterly bad taste. Unfortunately, however,
I can't excuse you because you didn't think.
You should have thought."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," agreed Amy eagerly, "and I don't
expect to be excused, sir. I only thought that
maybe you'd let up on the others if you knew how
it all happened. I thought maybe it would do just
as well if you expelled me, sir, and let the other
fellows off easy. Tom Hall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see. It's Hall who's worrying you, is it?
You're afraid Hall's absence from the team may
result disastrously! Possibly it will. If it does
I shall be sorry, but Hall will have to take his
medicine just like the rest of you. Perhaps this
will teach you all to think a little before you act.
No, Byrd, I shall have to refuse your offer. Expelling
you would not be disciplining the rest, nor
would it be an equitable division of punishment.
The verdict must stand, my boy."</p>

<p>Amy went sorrowfully forth and announced the
result to Clint. "I think he might have done what
I wanted," he complained a trifle resentfully.</p>

<p>"You're an utter ass," said Clint with unflattering
conviction. "What good would it do you
to get fired in your last year?"</p>

<p>"None, but if he'd have let the others off&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you suppose that the others would have
agreed to any such bargain? They're not kids,
even if you try to make them out so. They went
into the thing with their eyes open and are just as
much to blame as you are. They wouldn't let you
be the goat, you idiot!"</p>

<p>"They needn't have known anything about it,
Clint. Oh, well, I suppose there's no use fussing.
I don't care about the others. It's Tom I'm sorry
for. And the team, too. Pryme can't fill Tom's
shoes, and we'll get everlastingly walloped, and
it'll be my fault, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Piffle! Tom's a good player, one of the best,
but he isn't the whole team. Pryme will play the
position nearly as well. I'm sorry for Tom, too,
but he's the one who will have to do the worrying,
I guess. Now you buck up and quit looking like a
kicked cur."</p>

<p>"If only the fellows didn't have it in for him
the way they have," mourned Amy. "Everyone's
down on him and he knows it and he's worried to
death about it. They're a lot of rotters! After
the way Tom's worked on that team ever since he
got on it! Why, he's done enough for the school
if he never played another lick at anything! And
I'll tell you another thing. Someone's going to
get licked if I hear any more of this knocking!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll have to lick most of the school then,"
replied Clint calmly. "Try not to be a bigger
chump than nature made you, Amy. You can't
blame the fellows for being a bit sore at Tom. I
am myself. Only I realise that he didn't mean to
get into trouble with the office, and the rest of them
don't, I reckon. It'll all blow over in a few days.
Cheer up. A month from now you won't care a
whoop."</p>

<p>"If we're beaten by Claflin I'll get out of
school," answered Amy dolefully.</p>

<p>"All right, son, but don't begin to pack your
trunk yet. We won't be."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>SOUTHBY YIELDS</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> game with Southby Academy that week was
played away from home. As a general thing
Southby was not a formidable opponent and last
year's contest had resulted in a 17 to 3 win for
Brimfield. But this Fall Southby had been piling
up larger scores against her opponents and her
stock had risen. Consequently Brimfield, being deprived
of Tom Hall's services at right guard and
of Rollins's at full-back, journeyed off that morning
more than a little doubtful of the result of the
coming conflict. Most of the school went along,
since Southby was easily reached by trolley and
at a small outlay for fares, and Brimfield was
pretty well deserted by one o'clock. Out of some
one hundred and eighty students a scant forty
remained behind, and of that two-score we can
guess who nine were!</div>

<p>The game started with Edwards at left end for
Brimfield, Thayer at left tackle, Gilbert at left
guard, Peters at centre, Pryme at right guard,
Sturges at right tackle, Holt at right end, Carmine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
at quarter, St. Clair at left half, Otis at right half
and Martin at full-back. Later on, toward the
end of the second quarter, Thursby went in at
centre, and in the fourth period several substitutes
had their chances, amongst them Harry Walton.</p>

<p>Walton had begun to realise that he was playing
a losing game. Since Pryme had been shifted
back to the right side of the line Don Gilbert had
come more than ever to the fore and Harry had
spent a deal more time with the substitute squad
in practice and on the bench during scrimmage
than he approved of. Harry had a very special
reason for wanting to win that left guard position
and to play in it during the Claflin game, and this
afternoon, sitting on the side line with a dozen
other blanketed substitutes and enviously watching
Don in the coveted place, his brain evolved a
plan that promised so well that by the time the
second period had started he was looking almost
cheerful. And that is saying a good deal, since
Harry Walton's countenance very seldom expressed
cheer.</p>

<p>Southby showed her mettle within five minutes
of the kick-off, when, getting the ball on a fumble
on her forty-five yard line, she tore off thirty-three
yards on a complicated double-pass play and then,
ripped another down from the astonished adversary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
On the Maroon-and-Grey's nine yards, however,
her advance was halted, and after two downs
had resulted in a loss, she sent her kicker back and
placed a neat drop over the cross-bars, scoring
three points before the stop-watch had ticked off
six minutes of playing time.</p>

<p>That score was apparently just what Brimfield
needed to bring her to her senses, for the rest of
the period was marked by brilliant defensive work
on her part, followed toward the end of the twelve
minutes by some equally good attacks. When the
teams changed places Brimfield had the pigskin
on Southby's thirty-eight yards with four to go
on third down. A forward pass, Carmine to St.
Clair, produced three of the required four and
Martin slipped through between left guard and
tackle for the rest. After that ten well-selected
plays took the ball to the sixteen yards. But there
Southby rallied, and Steve Edwards, dropping
back as if to kick, tore off five more around the
left end. A touchdown seemed imminent now,
and the hundred or so Brimfield rooters shouted
and cheered madly enough. But two plunges at
the right of the Southby line were stopped for
scant gain and, with Martin back, a forward pass
to Holt missed that youth and fell plump into the
hands of a Southby end, and it was Southby's ball<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
on her eight yards when the dust of battle had
cleared away.</p>

<p>That was Brimfield's last chance to score in
that half and when the whistle sounded Southby
had the pigskin once more in her adversary's territory.</p>

<p>So far the teams had proved evenly matched in
all departments, with a possible slight superiority
in punting belonging to the visitors. St. Clair
and Martin divided the punting between them and
together they managed to outmatch the efforts of
the Southby kicker. In the line both teams were
excellent on defence, and both showed similar
weakness in attack. In Tom Hall's place Pryme
had worked hard and had, on the whole, done all
that was expected of him. But he wasn't Tom
Hall, and no amount of coaching would make him
Tom's equal that Fall. Pryme lacked two factors:
weight and, more especially, experience. Southby
had made some good gains through him in the
first half and would have made more had not
Peters and Sturges helped him valiantly. As to
the backfields, a disinterested spectator would have
liked the Brimfield players a bit the better, less
perhaps for what they actually accomplished that
day than for what they promised. Even with Rollins
out, the Maroon-and-Grey backs showed a fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and consistent solidarity that was lacking in the
opponents. Coach Robey was a believer in team-play
as opposed to the exploitation of stars, while
Southby, with a remarkable half-back in the person
of a blonde-haired youth named Elliston, had
built her backfield about one man. As a consequence,
when Elliston was smothered, as was frequently
the case, since Southby's opponents naturally
played for him all the time, the play was
stopped. Today Captain Edwards had displayed
an almost uncanny ability to "get" Elliston when
the play was in his direction, and so far the
blonde-haired star had failed to distinguish himself
save in that one thirty-three-yard gambol at
the beginning of the contest. What might happen
later was problematical, but so far Brimfield had
solved Elliston fairly well.</p>

<p>A guard seldom has an opportunity to pose in
the limelight, and so you are not to hear that Don
pulled off any brilliant feats that afternoon. What
he did do was to very thoroughly vindicate Mr.
Robey's selection of him for Gafferty's position
by giving an excellent impersonation of a concrete
block on defence and by doing rather better than
he had ever done before when his side had the ball.
Don had actually speeded up considerably, much
as Tim had assured him he could, and while he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
still by no means the snappiest man in the line, nor
was ever likely to be, he was seldom far behind
his fellows. For that matter the whole line of forwards
was still much slower than Mr. Robey
wanted them at that time of year, and Don showed
up not badly in comparison. After all, what is
needed in a guard is, first and foremost, fighting
spirit, and Don had that. If he was a bit slower to
sense a play, a little later in getting into it, at
least when he did start he started hard and tackled
hard and always played it safe. In the old days
when a guard had only his small territory between
centre and tackle to cover, Don would have been
an ideal player for the position, but now, when a
guard's duties are to free-lance, so to speak, from
one end of the line to the other and to get into
the play no matter where it comes, Don's qualifications
were more limited. A guard in these amazing
times is "soldier and sailor too," and Don,
who liked to deal with one idea at a time, found it
a bit confusing to have to grapple with a half-dozen!</p>

<p>Brimfield returned to the battle at the beginning
of the second half highly resolved to take no more
fooling from her opponent. Fortune ordered it
that the south goal should fall to her portion and
that a faint but dependable breeze should spring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
up between the halves. That breeze changed
Coach Robey's plans, and the team went on with
instructions to kick its way to within scoring distance
and then batter through the line at any cost.
And so the spectators were treated to a very
pretty punting exhibition by both teams, for,
wisely or unwisely, Southby accepted the challenge
and punted almost as often as her adversary.
That third period supplied many thrills but no
scoring, for although Brimfield did manage to get
the ball on Southby's twenty-five-yard line when a
back fumbled, the advantage ended there. Two
rushes failed, a forward pass grounded and when
St. Clair tried to skirt his own left end he was
pulled down just short of his distance and Southby
soon punted out of danger.</p>

<p>When time was called both teams made several
substitutions. Don yielded his place to Harry
Walton, Crewe went in at right tackle and McPhee
took Carmine's position at quarter. With the
advantage of the wind no longer hers, Brimfield
abandoned the kicking game and used her backfield
for all it was worth. From the middle of the
field to Southby's thirty yards she went without
much difficulty, St. Clair, Martin and Tim Otis
carrying the ball for short but consistent gains.
But at the thirty Southby braced and captured the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
pigskin on downs by a matter of inches. It was
then that Elliston repeated. Following two attempts
at Pryme's position, which yielded a scant
four yards, Elliston got away around Steve Edwards's
end and, with some good interference for
the first ten or twelve yards, passed the whole
field except McPhee and was only brought down
by that player after he had run to Brimfield's
twenty-six yards.</p>

<p>Southby's adherents cheered wildly and demanded
a touchdown, and it looked for awhile as
though their team was to give them what they
asked for. Southby twice poked a back through
the centre of the maroon-and-grey line and then
tore off ten yards around Clint Thayer, Steve
Edwards being put wholly out of the play. Then,
however, Brimfield dug her cleats and held the
enemy, giving a very heartening exhibition of
stubborn defence, and again Southby decided that
half a loaf was better than none and tried a field-goal.
She ought never to have got it, for the left
side of her line was torn to ribbons by the desperate
defenders. But she did, nevertheless, the ball
in some miraculous manner slipping through the
upstretched hands and leaping bodies and just topping
the bar.</p>

<p>Those three added points seemed to spell defeat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
for Brimfield, and many of her supporters in the
stand conceded the victory to Southby then and
there. But the team refused to view the matter
in that light and came back fighting hard. With
only some seven minutes of the twelve left, McPhee
opened the line when Southby had finally
been forced to punt from her twelve yards and St.
Clair had caught on his forty-five, and started a
series of direct-pass plays that, coming as they did
on the heels of an afternoon of close-formation
plays, confused the enemy until the ball had been
planted near her thirty-five yards. Brimfield
fought desperately then, closing her line again and
sending Edwards off on an end-around run that
took the pigskin eight yards nearer the last white
mark.</p>

<p>It was then that St. Clair really showed what
was in him. Four times he took the ball and four
times he plunged, squirming, fighting, through
the Southby centre and, with the Brimfield shouts
cheering him on, put the leather down at last on
Southby's eighteen. Otis got three off left tackle
and McPhee tried the same end for no gain. Martin
went back and, faking a kick, threw forward to
Edwards, who romped to the nine yards before he
was smothered. It was fourth down then, with
less than a yard to go, and St. Clair was called on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
A delayed-pass did the business and Southby was
digging her toes into her seven yards. Martin
slid off right tackle for two, bringing the ball
nearly in front of goal, and the defenders again
fell back.</p>

<p>Carmine was sent in again for McPhee and
Lawton took Pryme's place. Carmine evidently
brought instructions, for Captain Edwards fell
back to kicking position after the conference, and
the ball was passed to him. But with only five to
go and three downs to do it in a drop-kick was not
likely, especially as three points would still leave
Brimfield beaten, and so Southby disregarded the
bluff. But if a kick was out of the question a forward
pass was not, and it was a forward pass that
Southby set herself for. And so, with her ends
drawn out and her backs spread, the touchdown
came easily. For Steve faked a throw to the right,
where Holt apparently waited, and then dashed
straight ahead, the ball against his ribs, his head
down and his feet flying, struck the hastily-formed
massing of Southby's centre like a battering ram
and literally tore his way through until, when he
was at last pulled down, he was five yards over
the line!</p>

<p>Since Brimfield needed that goal badly, Rollins,
in spite of bandages, was sent in for Martin, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
when Carmine had canted the ball to his liking,
very calmly put it squarely between the uprights
above the bar.</p>

<p>The remaining minute and a half of play
brought no results and Brimfield trotted off victor
by the narrow margin of one point, while her adherents
flowed across the field cheering and flaunting
their banners in triumph.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>WALTON WRITES A NOTE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Southby game was played on the sixth of
November, a fortnight before the final contest with
Claflin School, and practically marked the end of
the preparatory season. Brimfield would meet
her blue-legged rival with what plays she had
already learned and the time for instruction was
passed. The remaining two weeks, which held but
ten playing days, would be devoted to perfecting
plays already known, to polishing off the rough
angles of attack and defence and to learning a
new set of signals as a matter of precaution.
Those ten days were expected to work a big improvement
in the team. Whether they would or
not remained to be seen.</div>

<p>On the whole, Brimfield had passed through a
successful season. She had played seven games,
of which she had lost one, won five and tied one.
Next week's adversary, Chambers, would in all
likelihood supply a sixth victory, in which case
the Maroon-and-Grey would face Claflin with a
nearly clean slate. Claflin, on her part, had hung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
up a rather peculiar record that Fall. She had
played one more game than Brimfield, had won
four, lost one and tied three. She had started out
strongly, had had a slump in mid-season and was
now, from all evidence at hand, recovering finely.
On comparative scores there was little to choose
between the rivals. If any perceptible advantage
belonged to Brimfield it was only because she had
maintained a steadier pace.</p>

<p>There was a lay-off for most of the first-string
players on Monday, a fact which gave Harry Walton
a chance to conduct himself very capably at
left guard during the four ten-minute periods of
scrimmage with the second. Don didn't go near
the field that afternoon and so was saved any of
the uneasiness which the sight of Walton's performance
might have caused him. Rollins got back
for a short workout and showed few signs of his
injury. The second team, profiting by some scouting
done by Coach Boutelle and Joe Gafferty on
Saturday, tried out the Claflin formation and such
Claflin plays as had been fathomed against the
first team and made some good gains thereby until
the second-string players solved them. On Tuesday
Harry Walton <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'disgruntedly'">disgruntledly</ins> found himself
again relegated to the bench during most of the
practice game and saw Don open holes in the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
team's line in a style that more than once
brought commendation from Coach Robey. Walton
glowered from the bench until Cotter disgustedly
asked if he felt sick. Whereupon Walton
grinned and Cotter, with a sigh, begged him to
scowl again!</p>

<p>The first team presented its full strength that
afternoon, and Mr. Boutelle's Claflin plays made
little headway. With Rollins back in place, the
first team scored almost at will during three
periods, and even after an entirely new backfield
was put in it continued to smash the second up
very effectually. Mr. Boutelle scolded and raved
and threatened, but all to scant purpose. The first
got its plays off very smoothly, played low and
hard and, for once, played together. The final
score that day was the biggest ever piled up in a
practice contest, 30 to 3. Had Mr. Robey allowed
Rollins to try goals from touchdowns it would
have been several points larger.</p>

<p>Tom Hall had so far carefully avoided the field,
but today he appeared there and sat in the stand
with Roy Draper and tried his best to be cheerful.
But his best wasn't very good. Already the feeling
against him had largely subsided, and the
school, realising, perhaps, that Tom's loss to the
team did not necessarily spell defeat for it, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
inclined to be sorry for him. But Tom didn't
realise that, since he still kept to himself and was
suspicious of advances. He hadn't quarrelled with
the school's verdict, but it had hurt him and, as he
didn't like being hurt any more than most of us,
he avoided the chance of it. In those days he stuck
pretty close to his room, partly because the office
required it and partly because he had no heart for
mingling with his fellows. Roy Draper had to
plead long and earnestly that afternoon to get him
to the gridiron. As badly as he felt about losing
his place on the team, however, Tom didn't begrudge
Pryme his good fortune, and he was honestly
pleased to see that the latter, in spite of his
deficiencies, would doubtless fill the right guard
position very capably in the Claflin game. He
studied Pryme's work attentively that afternoon,
criticised it and praised it and showed no trace of
animosity.</p>

<p>"He will do all right," he confided to Roy.
"Crewe will help him a lot, and so will Thursby.
If he could use his hands a bit better he'd be fine.
He holds himself nicely, doesn't he? On his toes
all the time. I hate to see a lineman play flat-footed.
That's one trouble with Don Gilbert.
Don's doing a heap better than he did last year,
though. I guess he's every bit as good as Joe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Gafferty. He's a regular whale on defence, isn't
he? He's a queer chap, Don, but a mighty nice
one."</p>

<p>"Don," replied Roy in his somewhat didactic
manner, "is the sort of fellow I'd pick out to be
cast away on a desert island with. He isn't so
scintillant, you know, but he'd wear forever."</p>

<p>"That's him to a T." Tom chuckled. "They
tell me Harry Walton is as mad as a hatter because
Don butted in and grabbed that position
away from him. Can't say I altogether blame
him, either. That is, there's no use getting mad
about it, but it is tough luck. Harry isn't a half-bad
guard, either."</p>

<p>"If he can play good football," answered Roy,
"I'm glad to know it. I've always wondered what
Walton was for."</p>

<p>Tom laughed. "Oh, he isn't so bad, I guess.
His manner's against him."</p>

<p>"I've noticed it," said Roy drily. "Also his
looks and his remarks and a number of other
things. Larry Jones says he comes from the best
sort of family."</p>

<p>"A fellow's family doesn't prove anything, I
guess."</p>

<p>"Evidently not. There's the whistle. Let's go
back." Presently Roy added, as they headed for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Torrence: "I can quite understand why Walton's
family sent him to school."</p>

<p>"Why they sent him to school?" repeated Tom
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was to get rid of him."</p>

<p>"You've certainly got your little hammer with
you," said Tom, with a smile. "What's Harry
done to you?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing. I wouldn't advise him to, either.
I just don't like him, Tom. Can't stand being in
the same room with him. Well, see you later, old
chap. And, say, think over what I said about&mdash;you
know."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," replied Tom, with a
shrug of his broad shoulders. "Fellows can think
what they like about me. I don't blame them.
But you can't expect me to like it!"</p>

<p>"I know, Tom, but they don't feel that way
now. It was just for a day or two. I've heard a
lot of fellows say lately that it's nonsense blaming
you, Tom. So come out of your shell, like a
sensible chap, and show that you don't feel any&mdash;any
ill-will."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't, I suppose. As for coming out
of my shell, I'll be crawling out pretty soon. Don't
bother about me, Roy. I'm feeling fine. So
long."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps what Tom really meant was that he was
feeling a whole lot better than he had a few days
before, for he certainly had not become quite
reconciled to the loss of his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'positon'">position</ins> with the team.
He was getting used to the idea, but he wasn't
happy over it. When he squarely faced the fact
that when Claflin came trotting onto the field on
the twentieth he would be sitting in the grand
stand instead of being out there in togs, his heart
sank miserably and he hardly knew whether he
wanted to kick something or get off in a corner
and cry. At such moments the question of
whether his school fellows liked him or detested
him bothered little. If he could only play against
Claflin, he assured himself, the school might hate
him to its heart's content!</p>

<p>Going on to Billings and his room, he considered
what Roy had told him of the altered sentiment
toward him, but somehow he didn't seem to care
so much today. Watching practice had brought
back the smart, and being liked or disliked seemed
a little thing beside the bigger trouble. Still, he
thought, if Roy was right perhaps he had better
meet fellows half-way. There was no use in being
a grouch. As a starter and in order to test the
accuracy of Roy's statement, he decided that he
would drop in on Carl Bennett, who roomed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Number 3. Bennett was a chap he rather respected
and, while they had never been very close
friends, Tom had seen a good deal of the other
during the Fall. But Bennett was not in and Tom
was making his way back to the stairs when the
door of Number 6 opened and Harry Walton came
out. Perhaps it was Roy's dressing-down of that
youth that prompted Tom to be more decent to
him than usual. At all events, Tom stopped and
hailed him and they conversed together on their
way up the stairs. It wasn't until later that Tom,
recalling Harry's grudge against Don, wondered
what had taken him to the latter's room. Then
he concluded that Harry had probably been calling
on Tim, and thought no more of it. Just now
he asked Harry how he was getting on with the
team and was a little puzzled when Harry replied:
"All right, I guess. Of course, Gilbert's got the
call right now, but I'm going to beat him out before
the big game. Did you see practice today?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You fellows put up a great game,
Harry."</p>

<p>"I didn't get into it for more than ten minutes.
Robey's playing Don Gilbert for all he knows."
Harry laughed disagreeably. "Robey's a bit of a
fox."</p>

<p>"How's that!" Tom inquired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he's sort of keeping me guessing, you see.
Thinks I'll get worried and dig harder."</p>

<p>"Huh. I see. You seem mighty certain of that
place, Harry."</p>

<p>"Sure, I'm certain. You just wait and see, old
top." Harry nodded and entered his room across
the hall, leaving Tom a trifle more sympathetic
toward Roy's estimation of him. Walton certainly
did have a disagreeable manner, he reflected.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Harry hadn't been calling
on anyone in Number 6 for the simple reason that
he had found no one at home. Moreover, he had
expected to find no one, for he had left Tim at the
gymnasium and seen Don and Harry Westcott sitting
in the window of the latter's room in Torrence
as he passed. What he had done was leave
a hastily scrawled note for Don on the table in
there, a note which Don discovered an hour later
and which at once puzzled and disturbed him.</p>

<p>"Come up and see me after supper will you,"
the note read, with a superb disdain of punctuation,
"I want to see you. Important. H. Walton."</p>

<p>"What's he want to see you about?" asked Tim
when Don tossed the note to him to read.</p>

<p>"I don't know." Don frowned thoughtfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope he isn't going to make trouble about that
old business."</p>

<p>"What old business?" asked Tim carelessly,
more interested in a set of bruised knuckles than
anything else just then.</p>

<p>"Why, you know Harry saw us climbing in the
window that night."</p>

<p>"Saw us climb&mdash;Well, what of it? That was
years ago. Why should he want to make trouble
about that? And how could he do it? I'd like to
see him start anything with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I just happened to think of that."</p>

<p>"More likely he's going to ask you to break a
leg or something so he can get your place,"
chuckled Tim. "Don't you do it, Don, if he does.
It doesn't pay to be too obliging. Ready for
eats?"</p>

<p>"In a minute." Don dropped the note and began
his toilet, but he didn't speak again until they
were on their way down the stairs. Then: "If
it should be that," he remarked, "I wouldn't
know whether to punch his head or laugh at
him."</p>

<p>"Don't take any chances," advised Tim grimly.
"Punch his head. Better still, bring the glad
tidings to me and let me do it. Why, if that idiot
threatened to open his face about us I'd give him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
such a walloping that his own folks wouldn't
recognise the remnants! Gee, but I'm hungry tonight!
Toddle along faster and let's get there
before Rollins and Holt and the rest swipe all the
grub."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>A PROPOSITION</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Don</span> sought Harry Walton's room soon after supper
was over and found neither Harry nor his
room-mate, Jim Rose, at home. He lighted the
droplight, found a magazine several months old
and sat down to wait. He had, however, scarcely
got into a story before Harry appeared.</div>

<p>"Hello," greeted the latter. "Sorry I was late.
Had to stop at the library for a book." In proof
of it he tossed a volume to the table. "I asked
you to come up here, Gilbert, because I have a
proposition to make and I thought you wouldn't
want anyone around." Harry seated himself,
took one knee into his clasped hands and smiled
at the visitor. It was a peculiarly unattractive
smile, Don decided.</p>

<p>"Proposition?" Don frowned perplexedly.
"What sort of a proposition, Walton?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you. It's like this, Gilbert. You
see, old man, you and I are fighting like the mischief
for the left guard position and so far it's
about nip-and-tuck, isn't it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Don viewed the speaker with some surprise.
"Is it?" he asked. "I thought I had rather the
best of it, Walton."</p>

<p>Harry smiled and shrugged. "That's only
Robey's foxiness. I'm not saying he might not
pick you for the place in the end, of course, but
I stand just as good a show. Robey doesn't like
to show his hand. He likes to keep you guessing.
I'm willing to bet that if nothing happened he'd
drop you next week and stick me in there. Of
course you might get in for awhile in the Claflin
game, if I got hurt, but I wouldn't advise you to
bank much on that because I'm rather lucky about
not getting hurt. Honestly, Gilbert, I don't really
think you've got much of a chance of final selection."</p>

<p>Don observed his host's countenance with some
bewilderment. "Well," he said at last, "that may
be so or not. What is it you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you." Harry tried hard to look ingenuous,
but only succeeded in grinning like a catfish.
"It's this way. My folks are coming up for
the Claflin game; father and mother and kid
brother, you know. Well, naturally, I'd like to
have them see me play. They think I'm going to,
of course, because I've mentioned it once or twice
in my letters. I'd feel pretty cheap if they came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
up here and watched me sitting on the bench all
through the game. See what I mean, old man?"</p>

<p>Don nodded and waited.</p>

<p>"Well, so I thought that as your chance is
pretty slim anyway maybe you wouldn't mind
dropping out. I wouldn't ask you to if I really
thought you had much chance, you know, Gilbert."</p>

<p>"Oh! That's it? Well, I'm sorry if you're
folks are going to be disappointed, Walton, but I
don't feel quite like playing the goat on that account.
You might just write them and sort of
prepare them for the shock, mightn't you? Tell
them there's a bare chance that you won't get into
the fracas, you know. I would. It would soften
the blow for them, Walton."</p>

<p>Walton scowled. "Don't be funny," he said
shortly. "I've given you the chance to drop out
gracefully, Gilbert, and you're a fool not to
take it."</p>

<p>"But why should I drop out! Don't you suppose
I want to play in the Claflin game just as
much as you do?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do, but you won't play in it any
way you figure it. If you don't quit willingly
you'll quit the other way. I'm giving you a fair
chance, that's all. You've only got to make believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
you're sick or play sort of rottenly a couple
of times. That will do the trick for you and there
won't be any other trouble."</p>

<p>"Say, what are you hinting at?" demanded Don
quietly. "What have you got up your sleeve?"</p>

<p>"Plenty, Gilbert. I've got enough up my sleeve
to get you fired from school."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. Then Don
nodded thoughtfully. "So that's it, is it?" he
murmured.</p>

<p>"That's it, old man." Harry grinned. "Think
it over now."</p>

<p>"What do you think you've got on me?" asked
Don.</p>

<p>"I don't think. I know that you and three other
fellows helped put out that fire that night and that
you didn't get back to hall until long after ten-thirty."
Harry dropped his knee, thrust his
hands into his pockets, leaned back in his chair
and viewed Don triumphantly. "I don't want to
go to faculty with it, Gilbert, although it's really
my duty and I certainly shall if you force me."</p>

<p>"Hm," mused Don. "But wouldn't faculty
wonder why you'd been so long about it?"</p>

<p>"Probably. I'd have to tell the truth and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I guess that would hurt," interpolated the
other drily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"And explain that I'd tried to shield you fellows,
but that my conscience had finally prevailed."
And Harry grinned broadly. "Josh
wouldn't like it, but he wouldn't do anything to
me. What he'd do to you, though, would be a
plenty, Gilbert. It would be expulsion, and you
know that as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do." Don dropped his gaze to his hands
and was silent a moment. Then: "Of course
you've thought of what it would mean to you, Walton?
I wouldn't be likely to keep you out of it,
you know."</p>

<p>Harry shrugged. "Fellows might talk some,
but I'd only be doing my duty. As long as my
conscience was clear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're a dirty pup, Walton," said Don, "and
if I wasn't afraid of getting the mange I'd give
you the beating you deserve."</p>

<p>"Calling names won't get you anything, Gilbert.
I'm not afraid of anything you could do to
me, anyway. I may be a pup, but I'm where
I can make you sit up and beg, and I'm going
to do it."</p>

<p>"You think you are," said Don contemptuously.
"Let me tell you now that I'd rather be fired a
dozen times than make any bargains with a common
skunk like you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"That means you want me to go ahead and tell
Josh, does it?"</p>

<p>"It means that you can do anything you want
to, Walton." Don stood up. "But if you do go
to faculty with the story you'll get the worst licking
you ever had or heard of, and fellows will
make it so unpleasant here for you that you won't
stay much longer than I do. Now <i>you</i> think it
over!"</p>

<p>"What fellows say or think won't hurt me a
mite, thank you, and I'm not afraid of you or any
of your friends, Gilbert. Wait a minute now.
We're not through yet."</p>

<p>"I am, thanks," replied Don, moving toward
the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, no you're not. You may feel heroic and
all that and too mad to give in just now, but you're
not considering what it will mean if you make me
squeal to faculty. Why, we wouldn't have a ghost
of a show with Claflin!"</p>

<p>"I thought you considered yourself quite
as good a guard as me, Walton," answered
Don.</p>

<p>"I do, old man. But I don't think I'm able to
take the places of all the other fellows who would
be missing from the team."</p>

<p>Don turned, with his hand on the door-knob, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
stared startledly. "What do you mean by that?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I thought that would fetch you," chuckled
Harry. "I mean that you're not the only one who
would quit the dear old school, Gilbert. You
haven't forgotten, I suppose, that there were three
other fellows mixed up in the business?"</p>

<p>"No, but faculty would have to know more than
I'd tell them before they'd find out who the others
were."</p>

<p>"Oh, you wouldn't have to tell them, old man."</p>

<p>"Meaning you would? You don't know, Walton."</p>

<p>"Don't I, though? You bet I do! I know every
last one of them!"</p>

<p>"You told me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I let you think I didn't, Gilbert. No use
telling everything you know."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" But, in spite of the statement,
Don did believe it and was trying to realise
what it meant. .</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool! Why wouldn't I know? If I
could see you why couldn't I see Clint Thayer and
Tim Otis and Tom Hall? You were all as plain as
daylight. Of course, Tom's out of it, anyway, but
I guess losing a left tackle and a right half-back a
week before the game would put rather a dent in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
our chances, what? And that's just what will
happen if you make me go to Josh with the
story!"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't!" challenged Don, but there was
scant conviction in his tone. Harry shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd rather not. I don't want to play on a
losing team, and that's what I'd be doing, but you
see I've sort of set my heart on playing right
guard a week from Saturday, Gilbert, and I hate
to be disappointed. Hate to disappoint my folks,
too."</p>

<p>"They must be proud of you!"</p>

<p>"They are, take it from me." Harry's smile
vanished and he looked ugly as he went on.
"Don't be a fool, Gilbert! You'd do the same
thing yourself if you had the chance. You're
playing the hypocrite, and you know it. I've got
you dead to rights and I mean to make the most
of it. If you don't get off the team inside of two
days I'll go to Josh and tell him everything I
know. It isn't pretty, maybe, but it's playing
your hand for what there is in it, and that's my
way! Now you sit down again and just think it
all over, Gilbert. Take all the time you want.
And remember this, too. If I keep my mouth shut
you've got to keep yours shut. No blabbing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Tim Otis or Clint Thayer or anyone else. This is
just between you and me, old man. Now what do
you say?"</p>

<p>"The thing's as crazy as it is rotten, Walton!
How am I to get off the team without having it
look funny?"</p>

<p>"And how much do I care whether it looks
funny or not? That's up to you. You can play
sick or you can get out there and mix your signals
a few times or you can bite Robey in the leg. I
don't give a hang what you do so long as you do
it, and do it between now and Saturday. That's
right, sit down and look at it sensibly. Mull it
over awhile. There's no hurry."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>DON VISITS THE DOCTOR</h3>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">What</span> did Walton want of you?" asked Tim a
half-hour later, when the occupants of Number 6
were settled at opposite sides of the table for
study.</div>

<p>"Walton?" repeated Don vaguely. "Oh, nothing
especial."</p>

<p>"Nothing especial? Then why the mysterious
summons? Did he make any crack about that
little escapade of ours?"</p>

<p>"He mentioned it. Shut up and let me get to
work, Tim."</p>

<p>"Mentioned it how? What did he say? Any
chance of beating him up? I've always had a
longing, away down deep inside me, Donald, to
place my fist violently against some portion of
Walton's&mdash;er&mdash;facial contour. Say, that's good,
isn't it? Facial contour's decidedly good, Don."</p>

<p>"Fine," responded the other listlessly.</p>

<p>Tim peered across at him under the droplight.
"Say, you look as if you'd lost a dozen dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
friends. Anything wrong? Look here, has Walton
been acting nasty?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a chump, Tim. I'm all right. Or,
anyway, I'm only sort of&mdash;sort of tired. Dry up
and let me stuff."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, but you needn't be so haughty
about it. I don't want to share your secrets with
dear Harry. Everyone to his taste, as the old lady
said when she kissed the cow."</p>

<p>Tim's sarcasm, however, brought no response,
and presently, after growling a little while he
pawed his books over and dropped the subject, to
Don's relief, and silence fell. Don made a fine
pretence of studying, but most of the time he
couldn't have told what book lay before him.
When the hour was up Tim, who had by then
returned to his usual condition of cheerful good
nature, tried to induce Don to go over to Hensey
to call on Larry Jones, who, it seemed, had perfected
a most novel and marvellous trick with a
ruler and two glasses of water. But Don refused
to be enticed and Tim went off alone, gravely
cautioning his room-mate against melancholia.</p>

<p>"Try to keep your mind off your troubles, Donald.
Think of bright and happy things, like me or
the pretty birds. Remember that nothing is ever
quite as bad as we think it is, that every line has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
a silver clouding and that&mdash;that it's always dawnest
before the dark. Farewell, you old grouch!"</p>

<p>Don didn't have to pretend very hard the next
day that he was feeling ill, for an almost sleepless
night, spent in trying to find some way out of his
difficulties, had left him hollow-eyed and pale.
Breakfast had been a farce and dinner a mere
empty pretence, and between the two meals he
had fared illy in classes. It was scarcely more
than an exaggeration to tell Coach Robey that he
didn't feel well enough to play, and the coach
readily believed him and gave him over to the
mercies of Danny Moore.</p>

<p>The trainer tried hard to get Don to enumerate
some tangible symptoms, but Don could only repeat
that he was dreadfully tired and out of sorts.
"Eat anything that didn't agree with you?" asked
Danny.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't eat much of anything. I didn't
have any appetite."</p>

<p>"Sure, that was sensible, anyway. I'll be after
giving you a tonic, me boy. Take it like I tell you,
do ye mind, keep off your feet and get a good
sleep. After breakfast come to me in the gym
and I'll have a look at you."</p>

<p>Don took the tonic&mdash;when he thought of it&mdash;ate
a fair supper and went early to bed, not so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in the hope of curing his ailment as because he
couldn't keep his eyes open any longer. He slept
pretty well, but was dimly conscious of waking
frequently during the night, and when morning
came felt fully as tired as when he had retired.
Breakfast was beyond him, although Mr. Robey,
his attention drawn to Don by Harry Walton's
innocent "You're looking pretty bum, Gilbert,"
counselled soft boiled eggs and hot milk. Don
dallied with the eggs and drank part of the milk
and was glad to escape as soon as he could.</p>

<p>Danny gave him a very thorough inspection in
the rubbing room after breakfast, but could find
nothing wrong. "Sure, you're as sound as Colin
Meagher's fiddle, me boy. Where is it it
hurts ye?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't hurt anywhere, Danny," responded
Don. "I'm all right, I suppose, only I don't feel&mdash;don't
feel very fit."</p>

<p>"A bit fine, you are, and I'm thinking you'd better
lay off the work for today. Be outdoors as
much as you can, but don't be tiring yourself out.
Have you taken the tonic like I told ye?"</p>

<p>"I've taken enough of the beastly stuff," answered
Don listlessly.</p>

<p>Danny laughed. "Sure, it's the fine-tasting
medicine, lad. Keep at it. And listen to me, now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
If you want to play agin Claflin, Donny, you do as
I'm tellin' you and don't be thinkin' you know
more about it than I do. Sure, Robey won't look
at ye at all, come a week from tomorrow, if you
don't brace up."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right, Danny, thanks. Maybe if I
rest off today I'll be fine tomorrow."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm tellin' you. See that ye
do it."</p>

<p>That afternoon he watched practice from the
bench without getting into togs and saw Harry
Walton play at left guard. He would much rather
have remained away from the field, but to have
done so might, he thought, have looked queer.
Coach Robey was solicitous about him, but apparently
did not take his indisposition very seriously.
"'Take it easy, Gilbert," he said, "and don't
worry. You'll be all right for tomorrow, I guess.
You've been working pretty hard, my boy. Better
pull a blanket over your shoulders. This
breeze is rather biting. Can't have you laid up
for long, you know."</p>

<p>Harry Walton performed well that afternoon,
playing with a vim and dash that was something
of a revelation to his team-mates. Tim was evidently
troubled when he walked back to hall with
Don after practice. "For the love of mud, Don,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
he pleaded, "get over it and come back! Did you
see the way Walton played today? If he gets in
tomorrow and plays like that against Chambers
Robey'll be handing him the place! What the
dickens is wrong with you, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I'm just tired," responded Don.</p>

<p>"Tired!" Tim was puzzled. "What for? You
haven't worked since day before yesterday. What
you've got is malaria or something. Tell you
what we'll do, Don; we'll beat it over to the doctor's
after supper, eh?"</p>

<p>But Don shook his head. "Danny's tonic is all
I need," he said. "I dare say I'll be feeling great
in the morning."</p>

<p>"You dare say you will! Don't you feel sure
you will? Because I've got to tell you, Donald,
that this is a plaguy bad time to get laid
off, son. If you're not a regular little Bright
Eyes by Monday Robey'll can you as sure as
shooting!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't much care if he did," muttered
Don.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't much&mdash;&mdash; Say, are you crazy?"
Tim stopped short on the walk and viewed his
chum in amazement. "Is it your brain that's gone
back on you? Don't you <i>want</i> to play against
Claflin?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose so. Yes, of course I do, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then don't talk like a piece of cheese! You'll
come with me to the doctor after supper if I have
to drag you there by one heel!"</p>

<p>And so go he did, and the doctor looked at his
tongue and felt his pulse and "pawed him over,"
as Don put it, and ended by patting him on the
back and accepting a nice bright half-dollar&mdash;half-price
to Academy students&mdash;in exchange for a
prescription.</p>

<p>"You're a little nervous," said the doctor.
"Thinking too much about that football game, I
guess. Don't do it. Put it out of your mind.
Take that medicine every two hours according to
directions on the bottle and you'll be all right, my
boy."</p>

<p>Don thanked him, slipped the prescription in a
pocket and headed for school. But Tim grabbed
him and faced him about. "You don't swallow
the prescription, Donald," he said. "You take it
to a druggist and he gives you something in a bottle.
That's what you swallow, the stuff in the
bottle. I'm not saying that it mightn't do you
just as much good to eat the paper, but we'd
better play by the rules. So come on, you lunk-head."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot," murmured Don.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course you did," agreed the other sarcastically.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"And, look here, if anyone asks</span><br />
you your name, it's Donald Croft Gilbert.
Think you can remember that? Donald
Croft&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, dry up," said Don. "How much will this
fool medicine cost me?"</p>

<p>"How much have you got?"</p>

<p>"About eighty cents, I think."</p>

<p>"It'll cost you eighty cents, then. Ask me
something easier. I don't pretend to know how
druggists do it, but they can always look right
through your clothes and count your money.
Never knew it to fail!"</p>

<p>But it failed this time, or else the druggist
counted wrong, for the prescription was a dollar
and Tim had to make up the balance. He insisted
on Don taking the first dose then and there,
so that he could get in another before bedtime,
and Don meekly obeyed. After he had swallowed
it he begged a glass of soda water from the druggist
to take the taste out of his mouth, and the
druggist, doubtless realising the demands of the
occasion, stood treat to them both. On the way
back Tim figured it that if they had only insisted
on having ice-cream sodas they would have reduced
the price of the medicine to its rightful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
cost. Don, though, firmly insisted that it was
worth every cent of what he had paid for it.</p>

<p>"No one," he said convincedly, "could get that
much nastiness into a small bottle for less than a
dollar!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>DROPPED FROM THE TEAM</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Whether</span> owing to Danny Moore's tonic, the doctor's
prescription or a good night's rest, Don
awoke the next morning feeling perfectly well
physically, and his first waking moments were
cheered by the knowledge. Then, however, recollection
of the fact that physical well-being was
exactly what wasn't required under the circumstances
brought quick reaction, and he jumped out
of bed to look at himself in the mirror above his
dresser in the hope of finding pale cheeks and
hollow eyes and similar evidences of impending
dissolution. But Fate had played a sorry trick on
him! His cheeks were not in the least pale, nor
were his eyes sunken. In short, he looked particularly
healthy, and if other evidence of the fact was
needed it was supplied by Tim. Tim, when Don
turned regretfully away from the glass, was sitting
up and observing him with pleased relief.</div>

<p>"Ata boy!" exclaimed Tim. "Feeling fine and
dandy, aren't you? I guess that medicine was
cheap at the price, after all! You look about a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
hundred per cent better than you did yesterday,
Donald."</p>

<p>Don started to smile, caught himself in time and
drew a long sigh. "You can't always tell by a fellow's
looks how he's really feeling," he replied
darkly.</p>

<p>"Oh, run away and play! What's the matter
with you? You've got colour in your face and
look great."</p>

<p>"Too much colour, I'm afraid," said Don,
shaking his head pessimistically. "I guess&mdash;I
guess I've got a little fever."</p>

<p>Tim stared at him puzzledly. "Fever? What
for? I mean&mdash;&mdash; Say, are you fooling?"</p>

<p>"No. My face is sort of hot, honest, Tim."
And so it was, possibly the consciousness of
fibbing and the difficulty of doing it successfully
was responsible for the flush. Tim pushed his
legs out of bed and viewed his friend disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Don, you're getting to be one of those kleptomaniacs&mdash;no,
that isn't it! What's the word?
Hydrochondriacs, isn't it? Anyway, whatever it
is, you're it! You've got so you imagine you're
sick when you aren't. Forget it, Donald, and
cheer up!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be all right, thanks," responded the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
other dolefully. "I guess I'm lots better than
I was."</p>

<p>"Of course you are! Why, hang it, man, you've
simply got to be O.&nbsp;K. today! If you're not
Robey'll can you as sure as shooting! Smile for
the gentleman, Don, and then get a move on and
come to breakfast."</p>

<p>"I don't think I want any breakfast, thanks."</p>

<p>"You will when you smell it. Want me to start
the water for you?"</p>

<p>"If I was a hydrochondriac I wouldn't want any
water, would I?"</p>

<p>"Hypochondriac's what I meant, I guess.
Hurry up before the mob gets there."</p>

<p>Tim struggled into his bath-robe and pattered
off down the corridor, leaving Don to follow at his
leisure. But, instead of following, Don seated
himself on the edge of his bed and viewed life
gloomily. If Tim refused to believe in his illness,
how was he to convince Coach Robey of it? He
might, he reflected, rub talcum on his face, but he
was afraid that wouldn't deceive anyone, the
coach least of all. And, according to his bargain
with Harry Walton, he must sever his connection
with the team today. If he didn't Walton would
go to the principal and tell what he had witnessed
from his window that Saturday night, and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
only he, but Tim and Clint as well, would suffer.
And, still worse, the team would be beaten by
Claflin as surely as&mdash;as Tim was shouting to him
from the bathroom! He got up and donned his
bath-robe and set off down the corridor with lagging
feet, so wretched in mind by this time that it
required no great effort of imagination to believe
himself ailing in body.</p>

<p>To his surprise&mdash;and rather to his disgust&mdash;he
found himself intensely hungry at breakfast
and it was all he could do to refuse the steak and
baked potato set before him. Under the appraising
eye of Mr. Robey, he drank a glass of milk and
nibbled at a piece of toast, his very soul longing
for that steak and a couple of soft eggs! Afterward,
when he reported to Danny, the trainer
produced fresh discouragement in him.</p>

<p>"Fine, me boy!" declared the trainer. "You're
as good as ever, aren't you? Keep in the air all
you can and go light with the dinner."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't feel very fit," muttered Don.</p>

<p>"Get along with you! You're the picture of
health! Don't be saying anything like that to Mr.
Robey, or he might believe it and bench you. Run
along now and mind what I tell you. Game's at
two-fifteen today."</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Don had but two recitations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that morning, for he was in no condition for
such unimportant things. His mind was too full
of what was before him. At dinner it was easy
enough to obey Danny's command and eat lightly,
for he was far too worried to want food. The
noon meal was eaten early in order that the players
might have an hour for digestion before they
went to the field. Chambers came swinging up to
the school at half-past one, in all the carriages to
be found at the station, while her supporters
trailed after on foot. The stands filled early and,
by the time the Chambers warriors trotted on to
the gridiron for their practice, looked gay and
colourful with waving pennants.</p>

<p>Don kept close to Tim from the time dinner was
over until they reached the locker-room in the
gymnasium. Tim was puzzled and disgusted over
his chum's behaviour and secretly began to think
that perhaps, after all, he was not in the condition
his appearance told him to be. Don listlessly
dragged his playing togs on and was dressed by
the time Coach Robey came in. He hoped that
the coach would give him his opportunity then to
declare his unfitness for work, but Mr. Robey paid
no attention to him. He said the usual few words
of admonition to the players, conferred with Manager
Morton and the trainer and disappeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
again. Captain Edwards led the way out of the
building at a few minutes before two and they
jogged down to the field and, heralded by a long
cheer from the stand, took their places on the
benches. It was a fine day for football, bright and
windless and with a true November nip in the
air.</p>

<p>Chambers yielded half the gridiron and Coach
Robey approached the bench. "All right, first and
second squads," he said cheerfully. "Try your
signals out, but take it easy. Rollins, you'd better
try a half-dozen goals. Martin, too. How about
you, Gilbert? You feeling all right?"</p>

<p>Don felt the colour seeping out of his cheeks as
the coach turned toward him, and there was an instant
of silence before he replied with lowered
eyes.</p>

<p>"N-no, sir, I'm not feeling very&mdash;very fit. I'm
sorry."</p>

<p>"You're not?" Mr. Robey's voice had an edge.
"Danny says you're perfectly fit. What's
wrong?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know, sir. I don't feel&mdash;well."</p>

<p>A number of the players still within hearing
turned to listen. Mr. Robey viewed Don with a
puzzled frown. Then he shrugged impatiently.</p>

<p>"You know best, of course," he said shortly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
"but if you don't work today, Gilbert, you're
plumb out of it. I can't keep your place open for
you forever, you know. What do you say? Want
to try it?"</p>

<p>Don wished that the earth under his feet would
open up and swallow him. He tried to return the
coach's gaze, but his eyes wandered. The first
time he tried to speak he made no sound, and when
he did find his voice it was so low that the coach
impatiently bade him speak up.</p>

<p>"I don't think it would be any good, sir," replied
Don huskily. "I&mdash;I'm not feeling very
well."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Then Mr. Robey's
voice came to him as cold as ice. "Very well, Gilbert,
clean your locker out and hand in your
things to the trainer. Walton!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Go in at left guard on the first squad." Mr.
Robey turned again to Don. "Gilbert," he said
very quietly, "I don't understand you. You are
perfectly able to play, and you know it. The only
explanation that occurs to me is that you're in a
funk. If that's so it is a fortunate thing for all
of us that we've discovered it now instead of later.
There's no place on this team, my boy, for a
quitter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Coach and players turned away, leaving Don
standing alone there before the bench. Miserably
he groped his way to it and sat down with hanging
head. His eyes were wet and he was horribly
afraid that someone would see it. A hand fell on
his shoulder and he glanced up into Tim's troubled
face.</p>

<p>"I heard, Don," said Tim. "I'm frightfully
sorry, old man. Are you sure you can't do it!"</p>

<p>Don shook his head silently. Tim sighed.</p>

<p>"Gee, it's rotten, ain't it? Maybe he didn't
mean what he said, though. Maybe, if you're all
right Monday, he'll give you another chance.
I'm&mdash;I'm beastly sorry, Don!"</p>

<p>The hand on his shoulder pressed reassuringly
and drew away and Tim hurried out to his place.
Presently Don took a deep breath, got to his feet
and, trying his hardest to look unconcerned but
making sorry work of it, skirted the stand and
retraced his steps to the gymnasium. His one
desire was to get out of sight before any of the
fellows found him, and so he pulled off his togs
as quickly as he might, got into his other clothes,
made a bundle of his suit and stockings and shoes
and left them in the rubbing-room where Danny
could not fail to find them and then hurried out of
the building and through the deserted yard to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Billings and the sunlit silence and emptiness of his
room.</p>

<p>There was very little consolation in the knowledge
that he had done only what was right. Martyrdom
has its drawbacks. He had lost his position
with the team and had been publicly branded
a quitter. The fact that his conscience was not
only clear but even approving didn't help much.
Being thought a quitter, a coward, hurt badly. If
he could have got at Harry Walton any time during
the ensuing half-hour it would have gone hard
with that youth. After a time, though, he got command
of his feelings again and, since there was
nothing better to do, he seated himself at the
window and watched as much of the football game as
was visible from there. Once or twice he was able
to forget his trouble for a brief moment.</p>

<p>Chambers put up a good game that day and it
was all the home team could do to finally win out
by the score of 3 to 0. For two periods Chambers
had Brimfield virtually on the run, and only a
fine fighting spirit that flashed into evidence under
the shadow of her goal saved the latter from defeat.
As it was, luck took a hand in matters when
a poor pass from centre killed Chambers's chance
of scoring by a field-goal in the second quarter.</p>

<p>Brimfield showed better work in the second half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and twice got the ball inside the visitor's twenty-yard
line, once in the third period and again
shortly before the final whistle blew. The first
opportunity to score was lost when Carmine called
for line-plunges to get the pigskin across and
Howard, who was playing in St. Clair's position
because of a slight injury to the regular left half,
fumbled for a four-yard loss. Chambers rallied
and took the ball away a minute later. In the
fourth period dazzling runs outside of tackles by
Tim Otis and hard line-plugging by Rollins and
Howard took the ball from Brimfield's thirty-five
to the enemy's twenty-five. There a forward pass
grounded&mdash;Chambers had a remarkable defence
against that play&mdash;and, on third down, Rollins slid
off left tackle for enough to reach the twenty.
But with only one down remaining and time nearly
up, a try-at-goal was the only course left, and
Rollins, standing squarely on the thirty-yard line,
drop-kicked a scanty victory.</p>

<p>In some ways that contest was disappointing,
in others encouraging. Team-play was more in
evidence than in any previous game and the
maroon-and-grey backfield had performed prodigiously.
And the plays had, as a general thing,
gone off like clock-work. But there were weak
places in the line still. Pryme, at right guard, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
proved an easy victim for the enemy and the same
was true, in a lesser degree, of Harry Walton,
on the other side of centre. And Crewe, at right
tackle, had allowed himself to be boxed time after
time. It might be said for Crewe, however, that
today he was playing opposite an opponent who
was more than clever. But the way in which
Chambers had torn holes in Brimfield's first defence
promised poorly for next Saturday and the
spectators went away from the field feeling a bit
less sanguine than a week before. "No team that
is weak at both guard positions can hope to win,"
was the general verdict, and it was fully realised
that Claflin's backs were better than Chambers's.
For a day or two there was much talk of a petition
to the faculty asking for the reinstatement of Tom
Hall, but it progressed no further than talk. Josh,
it was known, was not the kind to reverse his decision
for any reason they could present.</p>

<p>And yet, although the weekly faculty conference
on Monday night had no written petition to consider,
the subject of Tom's reinstatement did come
before it and in a totally unprecedented manner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>"GOOD-BYE, TIMMY!"</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Tim</span> found a dejected and most unsatisfactory
chum when he got back to the room after the
Chambers game that Saturday afternoon. All of
Tim's demands for an explanation of the whole
puzzling affair met only with evasion. Don was
not only uncommunicative, but a trifle short-tempered,
a condition quite unusual for him. All Tim
could get from him was that he "felt perfectly
punk" and wasn't going to try to change Mr.
Robey's decision.</div>

<p>"I'm through," he said. "I don't blame Robey
a bit. I'm no use on the team as I am. He'd be
foolish to bother with me."</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say," returned Tim, with a
sigh of exasperation, "is that the whole thing is
mighty funny. I guess there's more to it than
you're telling. You look like thirty cents, all right
enough, but I'll wager anything you like that you
could go out there and play just as good a game
as ever on Monday if Robey would let you and you
cared to try. Now couldn't you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know. What does it matter, anyhow?
I tell you I'm all through, and so there's no use
chewing it over."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. Nuff said." Tim walked to the
window, his hands thrust deep in his pockets, and,
after a minute's contemplation of the darkening
prospect without, observed haltingly: "Look
here, Don. If you hear things you don't like,
don't get up on your ear, eh?"</p>

<p>"What sort of things?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>Tim hesitated a long moment before he took
the plunge. Then: "Well, some of the fellows
don't understand, Don. You can't altogether
blame them, I suppose. I shut two or three of
them up, but there's bound to be some talk, you
know. Some fellows always manage to think of
the meanest things possible. But what fellows
like that say isn't worth bothering about. So
just you sit snug, old man. They've already found
that they can't say that sort of thing when I'm
around."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Don quietly. "What sort of
things do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anything."</p>

<p>"You mean that they're calling me a quitter?"</p>

<p>"Well, some of them heard Robey get that off
and they're repeating it like a lot of silly parrots.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
I called Holt down good and hard. Told him I'd
punch his ugly face if he talked that way again."</p>

<p>"Don't bother," said Don listlessly. "I guess
I do look like a quitter, all right."</p>

<p>"Piffle! And, hang it all, Robey had no business
saying that, Don! He couldn't really believe
it."</p>

<p>"Why couldn't he? On the face of it, Tim, I'd
say that I looked a whole lot like a quitter."</p>

<p>"But that's nonsense! Why would you or any
fellow want to quit just before the Claflin game?
Why, all the hard work's done with, man! Only
a little signal practice to go through with now.
Why would you want to quit? It's poppycock!"</p>

<p>"Well, some fellows do get cold feet just before
the big game. We've both known cases of it.
Look at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you're going to say, but that
was different. He never had any spunk, anyway.
Nobody believed in him but Robey, and Robey was
wrong, just as he is about you. Anyway, all I'm
trying to say is that there's no use getting waxy
if some idiot shoots off his mouth. The fellows
who really count don't believe you a&mdash;a quitter.
And the whole business will blow over in a couple
of days. Look how they talked about Tom at
first!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"They didn't call him a quitter, though. They
were just mad because he'd done a fool thing and
lost the team. I wouldn't blame anyone for thinking
me a&mdash;a coward, and I can't resent it if they
say it."</p>

<p>"Can't, eh? Well, I can!"</p>

<p>Don smile wanly. "Thought you were telling
me not to, Tim."</p>

<p>Tim muttered. There was silence for a minute
in the twilit room. Then Tim switched on the
lights and rolled up his sleeves preparatory to
washing. "The whole thing's perfectly rotten,"
he growled, "but we'll just have to make the best
of it. Ten years from now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it isn't ten years from now that
troubles me," interrupted Don thoughtfully. "It&mdash;it's
right this minute. And tomorrow and the
next day. And the day after that. I've a good
mind to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To what?" demanded Tim from behind his
sponge.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I was just&mdash;thinking."</p>

<p>"Well, stop it, then. You weren't intended to
think. You always do something silly when you
get to thinking. Wash up and come on to supper."</p>

<p>"I'm not going over tonight," answered Don.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
"I'm not hungry. And, anyway, I don't feel quite
like facing it yet."</p>

<p>"Now, look here," began Tim severely, "if
you're going to take it like that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not, I guess. Only I'd rather not go to
supper tonight. I am through at the training-table
and I funk going back to the other table just
now. Besides, I'm not the least bit hungry. You
run along."</p>

<p>Tim observed him frowningly. "Well, all right.
Only if it was me I'd take the bull by the horns
and see it through. Fellows will talk more if you
let them see that you give a hang."</p>

<p>"They'll talk enough anyway, I dare say. A
little more won't matter."</p>

<p>"I just hope Holt gets gay again," said Tim
venomously, shying the towel in the general direction
of the rack and missing it by a foot. "Want
me to bring something over to you?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks. I don't want a thing."</p>

<p>"We-ell, I guess I'll beat it then." Tim loitered
uncertainly at the door. "I say, Donald, old
scout, buck up, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll be all right, Timmy. Don't you
worry about me. And&mdash;and thanks, you know,
for&mdash;for calling Holt down."</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" Tim chuckled. "Holt wasn't the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
only one I called down either." Then, realising
that he had not helped the situation any by the
remark, he tried to squirm out of it. "Of course,
Holt was <i>the</i> one, you know. The others didn't
really <i>say</i> anything, or&mdash;or mean anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Don laughed. "That'll do, Tim. Beat it!"</p>

<p>And Tim, red-faced and confused, "beat it."</p>

<p>For the next five minutes doors in the corridor
opened and shut and footfalls sounded as the fellows
hurried off to Wendell. But I doubt if Don
heard the sounds, for he was sunk very low in
the chair and his eyes were fixed intently on space.
Presently he drew in his legs, sat up and pulled
his watch from his pocket. A moment of speculation
followed. Then he jumped from the chair as
one whose mind is at last made up and went to
his closet. From the recesses he dragged forth
his bag and laid it open on his bed. From the
closet hooks he took down a few garments and
tossed them beside the bag and then crossed to his
dresser and pulled open the drawers. Don had
decided to accept Coach Robey's title. He was
going to quit!</p>

<p>There was a train at six-thirty-four and another
at seven-one for New York. With luck, he could
get the first. If he missed that he was certain of
the second. The dormitory was empty, it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
quite dark outside by now and there was scarcely
a chance of anyone's seeing him. If he hurried he
could be at the station before Tim could return
from supper. Or, even if he didn't get away until
the seven-one train, he would be clear of the hall
before Tim could discover his absence and surmise
the reason for it. To elude Tim was the all-important
thing, for Tim would never approve and
would put all sorts of obstacles in his way. In
fact, it would be a lot like Tim to hold him back
by main force! Don's heart sank for a moment.
It was going to be frightfully hard to leave old
Timmy. Perhaps they might meet again at college
in a couple of years, but they would not be
likely to see each other before that time, and even
that depended on so many things that it couldn't
be confidently counted on.</p>

<p>Don paused in his hurried selection of articles
from the dresser drawers and dropped into a
chair at the table. But, with the pad before him
and pen in hand, he shook his head. A note would
put Tim wise to what was happening and perhaps
allow him to get to the station in time to make a
fuss. No, it would be better to write to him later;
perhaps from New York tonight, for Don was
pretty sure that he wouldn't be able to get a
through train before morning. So, with another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
glance at his watch, he began to pack again, throwing
things in every which-way in his feverish desire
to complete the task and leave the building
before Tim got back. He came across a scarf that
Tim had admired and laid it back in the top
drawer. It had never been worn and Tim should
have it. And as he hurried back and forth he
thought of other things he would like Tim to have.
There was his tennis racket, the one Tim always
borrowed when Don wasn't using it, and a scarf-pin
made of a queer, rough nugget of opal matrix.
He would tell Tim he was to have those and not
to pack them with the other things. The thought
of making the gifts almost cheered him for awhile,
and, together with the excitement of running
away, caused him to hum a little tune under his
breath as he jammed the last articles in the bag
and snapped it shut.</p>

<p>It was sixteen minutes past now. He would, he
acknowledged, never be able to make the six-thirty-four,
with that burden to carry. But the
seven-one would do quite as well, and he wouldn't
have to hurry so. In that case, then, why not
leave just a few words of good-bye for Tim? He
could put the note somewhere where Tim wouldn't
find it until later; tuck it, for instance, under the
bed-clothes so that he would find it when he pulled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
them down. He hesitated a moment and then set
his bag down by the door, dropped his overcoat
and umbrella on the bed and seated himself again
at the table. Tim was never known to take less
than a half-hour for supper and he still had a
good ten minutes' leeway:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dear Timmy [he wrote hurriedly], I'm off.
It's no use sticking around any longer. Fellows
aren't going to forget as soon as you said and I
can't stay on here and be thought a quitter. So
I'm taking the seven-one to New York and will be
home day after tomorrow. I wish you would pack
my things up for me when you get time. There
isn't any great hurry. I've got enough for awhile.
You're to keep the racket and the blue and white
tie and the opal matrix pin and anything else you
like to remember me by. Please do this, Tim. I'll
write from home and tell you about sending the
trunk. I'm awfully sorry, Tim, and I'm going to
miss you like anything, but I shan't ever come
back here. Maybe we will get together again at
college. I hope so. You try, will you? Good-bye,
Tim, old pal. We've had some dandy times
together, haven't we? And you've been an A1
chum to me and I wish I wasn't going off without
saying good-bye to you decently. But I've got to.
So good-bye, Timmy, old man. Think of me now
and then like I will of you. Good-bye.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"Your friend always,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Don.</span>"<br />
</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>That note took longer to write than he had
counted on, and when he got up from the table
and looked at his watch he was alarmed to find
that it was almost half-past six. He folded the
paper and tucked it just under the clothes at the
head of Tim's bed, took a last glance about the
room, picked up coat and umbrella and turned out
the light. Then he strode toward the door, groping
for his bag.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>FRIENDS FALL OUT</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Tim</span> didn't enjoy supper very much that evening.
The game had left him pretty weary of body and
mind, and on top of that was Don and his trouble,
and try as he might he couldn't get them out of his
thoughts. Mr. Robey was not at table; someone
said he had gone to New York for over Sunday;
and so Tim didn't have to make a pretence of
eating more than he wanted. And he wanted very
little. A slice of cold roast beef, rather too rare
to please him, about an eighth of one of the inevitable
baked potatoes, a few sips of milk and a
corner of a slice of toast as hard as a shingle, and
Tim was more than satisfied. Tonight he was not
especially interested in the talk, which, as usual
after a game, was all football, and didn't see any
good reason for sitting there after he had finished
and listening to it. All during his brief meal he
was on the alert for any mention of Don's name,
and more than once he glared, almost encouragingly,
at Holt. But Holt had already learned his
lesson and was doing very little talking, and none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
at all about Don. Nor was the absent player's
name mentioned by anyone at that table, although
what might be being said of him at the other Tim
had no way of knowing. He stayed on a few minutes
after he had finished, eyeing the apple-sauce
and graham crackers coldly, and then asked Steve
Edwards to excuse him.</div>

<p>"Off his feed," remarked Carmine as Tim
passed down the dining hall on his way out.
"First time I ever saw old Tim have nerves."</p>

<p>"It's Don Gilbert, probably," said Clint
Thayer. "They're great pals. Tim's worried
about him, I guess."</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Steve?" asked Crewe,
helping himself to a third slice of meat.</p>

<p>"What is there to make of it?" asked Steve
carelessly. "The chap's all out of shape, I suppose.
I don't know what his trouble is, but I
guess he's a goner for this year."</p>

<p>"It's awfully funny, isn't it?" asked Rollins.
"Gilbert always struck me as an awfully plucky
player."</p>

<p>"Has anyone said he isn't?" inquired Clint
quietly.</p>

<p>"N-no, no, of course not!" Rollins flushed. "I
didn't mean anything like that, Clint. Only I
don't see&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"He hasn't been looking very fit lately," offered
Harry Walton. "I noticed it two or three days
ago. Too bad!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you're feeling perfectly wretched about
it, I guess," said big Thursby drily, causing a
smile around the table. Walton shrugged and
rewarded the speaker with one of his smiles that
were always unfortunately like leers.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can feel sorry for him," said Walton,
"even if I do get his place. Gilbert gave me an
awfully good fight for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, was there a fight?" asked Thursby innocently.
"I didn't notice any."</p>

<p>Thursby got a real laugh this time and Harry
Walton joined in to save his face, but with no very
good grace.</p>

<p>"If anyone has an idea that Don Gilbert is
scared and quit for that reason," observed St.
Clair, "he'd better keep it to himself. Or, anyhow,
he'd better not air it when Tim is about. He
nearly bit my head off in the gym because I said
that Don was a chump to give up like this a week
before the Claflin game. Tim flared up like&mdash;like
a gasoline torch and wanted to fight! I didn't
mean a thing by my innocent remark, but I had the
dickens of a time trying to prove it to Tim! And
he almost jumped into you, too, didn't he, Holt?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he did, the touchy beggar! You all heard
what Robey said, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't hear," interrupted Steve, "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, he said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And, as I was about to remark, Holt, I don't
want to. And it will be just as decent for those
who did hear to forget. Robey says lots of things
he doesn't mean or believe. Perhaps that was one
of them. I'm for Don. If he says he's sick, he is
sick. You've all seen him play for two years and
you ought to know that there isn't a bit of yellow
anywhere in his make-up."</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed several, and others nodded,
Holt amongst them.</p>

<p>"I didn't say he was a quitter, Steve. I was
only repeating what Robey said, and Tim happened
to hear me. Gee, I like Don as well as any
of you. Gee, didn't I play a whole year with him
on the second?"</p>

<p>"Gee, you did indeed!" replied Crewe, and,
laughing, the fellows pushed back their chairs and
left the table.</p>

<p>Tim didn't hurry on his way along the walk to
Billings, for he was earnestly trying to think of
some scheme that would take Don's mind off his
trouble that evening. Perhaps he could get Don
to take a good, long walk. Walking always worked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
wonders in his own case when, as very infrequently
happened, he had a fit of the blues. Yes,
he would propose a walk, he told himself. And
then he groaned at the thought of it, for he was
very tired and he ached in a large number of
places!</p>

<p>Only a few windows were lighted in Billings as
he approached it, for most of the fellows were
still in dining hall and the rule requiring the turning
out of lights during absence from rooms was
strictly enforced. Only the masters were exempted,
and Tim noticed as he passed Mr. Daley's
study that the droplight was turned low by one
of those cunning dimming attachments which Tim
had always envied the instructor the possession
of. Tim would have had one of those long ago
could he have put it to any practical use. He
passed through the doorway and down the dimly
lighted corridor, the rubber-soled shoes which he
affected in all seasons making little sound. He
was surprised to see that no light showed through
the transom of Number 6, and he paused outside
the door a moment. Perhaps Don was asleep. In
that case, it would be just as well to not disturb
him. But, on the other hand, he might be just
sitting there in the dark being miserable. Tim
turned the knob and pushed the door open.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The light from the corridor and the fact that
Don had stopped startledly at the sound of the
turning knob prevented an actual collision between
them. Tim, pushing the door slowly shut
behind him, viewed Don questioningly. "Hello,"
he said, "where are you going?"</p>

<p>"For a walk," replied Don.</p>

<p>"Why the coat and umbrella? And&mdash;oh, I
see!" Tim's glance took in the bag and comprehension
dawned. "So that's it, eh?"</p>

<p>There was an instant of silence during which
Tim closed the door and leaned against it, hands
in pockets and a thoughtful scowl on his face.
Finally:</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it," said Don defiantly. "I'm off
for home."</p>

<p>"What's the big idea?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough, Tim. I&mdash;I'm not going
to stay here and be&mdash;be pointed out as a quitter.
I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a sec! What are you doing now but
quitting, you several sorts of a blind mule? Think
you're helping things any by&mdash;by running away?
Don't be a chump, Donald."</p>

<p>"That's all well enough for you. It isn't your
funeral. I don't care what they say about me if
I don't have to hear it. I'm sorry, Tim, but&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
I've just got to do it. I&mdash;there's a note for you
in your bed. I didn't expect you'd be back before
I left."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you didn't, son!" said Tim grimly.
"Now let me tell you something, Don. You're
acting like a baby, that's what you're doing! It's
all fine enough to say that you don't care what
fellows say as long as you don't hear it, but you
don't mean it, Don. You would care. And so
would I. If you don't want them to think you a
quitter, for the love of mud don't run away like&mdash;like
one!"</p>

<p>"I've thought of all that, Tim, but it's the only
thing to do."</p>

<p>"The only thing to do, your grandmother! The
thing to do is to stick around and show folks that
you're <i>not</i> a quitter. Don't you see that getting
out is the one thing that'll make them believe
Robey was right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say, but I've made up my mind,
Tim. I'm going to get that seven-one train, old
man, and I'll have to beat it. If you want to walk
along to the station with me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And carry your bag?" asked Tim sweetly. He
turned the key in the lock and then dropped it in
his pocket. Don took a stride forward, but was
met by Tim's challenging frown. "There's no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
seven-one train for you tonight, Donald," said
Tim quietly, "nor any other night. Put your bag
down, old dear, and hang your overcoat back in
the closet."</p>


<p>"Don't act like a silly ass," begged Don. "Put
that key back and let me out, Tim!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will&mdash;like fun! The only way you'll
get that key will be by taking it out of my pocket,
and by the time you do that the seven-one train
will be half-way to the city."</p>

<p>"Please, Tim! You're not acting like a good
chum! Just you think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's just what I am acting like," returned
Tim, stepping past the other and switching on the
lights. "And you'll acknowledge it tomorrow.
Just now you're sort of crazy in the head.
I'll humour you as much as possible, Donald,
but not to the extent of letting you make
a perfect chump of yourself. Sit down and
behave."</p>

<p>"Tim, I want that key," said Don sternly.</p>

<p>Tim shrugged. "Can't have it, Don, unless you
fight for it. And I'm not sure you'd get it then.
Now look here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've no right to keep me here!"</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/gs03.jpg" width="309" height="400" alt="&quot;Will you unlock that door?&quot; demanded Don angrily" title="&quot;Will you unlock that door?&quot; demanded Don angrily" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Will you unlock that door?&quot; <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Demanded'">demanded</ins> Don angrily</span>
</div>

<p>"I don't give a hang whether I've got the right
or not. You're going to stay here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are other trains," said Don coldly.
"You can't keep that door locked forever."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to try, but it'll stay locked until
the last train tonight has whistled for the crossing
back there. Make up your mind to that, son!"</p>

<p>Don looked irresolutely from Tim to the door
and back again. He didn't want to fight Tim the
least bit in the world. He wasn't so sure now that
he wanted to get that train, either. But, having
stated his purpose, he felt it encumbent on him to
carry it out. Then his gaze fell on the windows
and he darted toward them.</p>

<p>But Tim had already thought of that way of
escape and before Don had traversed half the distance
from door to windows Tim had planted himself
resolutely in the way. "No you don't, Donald,"
he said calmly. "You'll have to lick me
first, boy, and I'm feeling quite some scrappy!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to lick you," said Don irritably,
"but I mean to get that train. You'd better either
give up that key or stand out of my way, Tim."</p>

<p>"Neither, thanks. And, look here, if we get to
scrapping Horace will hear us and then you won't
get away in any case. Be sensible, Don, and give
it up. It can't be done, old man."</p>

<p>"Will you unlock that door?" demanded Don
angrily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, confound you, I won't!"</p>

<p>"Then I'm going out by the window!"</p>

<p>"And I say you're not." Tim swiftly peeled
off his coat. "Anyway, not in time to get that
train."</p>

<p>Don dropped his bag to the floor and tossed
overcoat and umbrella on his bed. "I've given
you fair warning, Tim," he said in a low voice.
"I don't want to hurt you, but you'd better stand
aside."</p>

<p>"I don't want to get hurt, Don," replied the
other quietly, "but if you insist, all right.
I'm doing what I'd want you to do, Don,
if I went crazy in the head. You may not
like it now, but some day you'll tell me I did
right."</p>

<p>"You're acting like a fool," answered Don
hotly. "It's no business of yours if I want to get
out of here. Now you let me pass, or it'll be the
worse for you!"</p>

<p>"Don, will you listen to reason? Sit down
calmly for five minutes and let's talk this thing
over. Will you do that?"</p>

<p>"No! And I won't be dictated to by you, Tim
Otis! Now get out of the way!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to put me out," answered Tim
with set jaw. "And you're going to find that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
hard work, Donald. We're both going to get horribly
mussed up, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Tim didn't finish his remark, for at that
instant Don rushed him. Tim met the onslaught
squarely and in a second they were struggling
silently. No blows were struck. Don was bent
only on getting the other out of the way and
making his escape through the open window there,
while Tim was equally resolved that he should do
nothing of the sort. In spite of Don's superior
weight, the two boys were fairly equally matched,
and for a minute or two they strained and
tussled without advantage to either. Then
Tim, his arms wrapped around Don's body
like iron bands, forced the latter back a step
and against a chair which went crashing
to the floor. Don tore at the encircling arms,
panting.</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;want to&mdash;hurt you," he muttered,
"but&mdash;I will&mdash;if you don't&mdash;let go!"</p>

<p>There was no answer from Tim, but the grip
didn't relax. Don worked a hand under the
other's chin and tried to force his head back. Tim
gave a little and they collided with the window-seat,
stumbled and slid together to the floor, Don
on top. For a moment they writhed and thrashed
and then Don worked his right arm loose, slowly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
tore Tim's left hand away and held it down to
the floor.</p>

<p>"Let go or I'll punch you, Tim," he panted.</p>

<p>"Punch&mdash;ahead!"</p>

<p>Don strained until he felt Tim's other hand
giving, and then, with a sudden fling of his body,
rolled clear and jumped to his feet. But Tim was
only an instant behind him and, panting and
dishevelled, the two boys confronted each other,
silent.</p>

<p>"I'm going out there," said Don after a moment.</p>

<p>Tim only shook his head and smiled crookedly.</p>

<p>"I am, Tim, and&mdash;and you mustn't try to stop
me this time!"</p>

<p>"I've&mdash;got to, Don!"</p>

<p>"I'm giving you fair warning!"</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>Don took a deeper breath and stepped forward.
"Don't touch me!" he warned. But Tim was
once more in his path, hands stretched to clutch
and hold. "Out of my way, Tim! Fair warning!"
Don's face was white and his eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"No!" whispered Tim, and crouched.</p>

<p>Then Don went on again. Tim threw himself
in the way, a fist shot out and Tim, with a grunt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
went back against the pillows and slipped heavily
to the floor.</p>

<p>Don's hands fell to his sides and he stared bewilderedly.
Then, with a groan, he dropped to his
knees and raised Tim's head from the floor. "Gee,
but I'm sorry, Timmy!" he stammered. "I didn't
mean to do it, honest! I was crazy, I guess!
Timmy, are you all right!"</p>

<p>Tim's eyes, half-closed, fluttered, he drew a
deep breath and his head rolled over against Don's
arm.</p>

<p>"Timmy!" cried Don anxiously. "<i>Timmy!</i>
Don't you hear me! I didn't hit you awfully
hard, Timmy!"</p>

<p>Tim sighed. "What&mdash;time is it?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Time? Never mind the time. Are you all
right, Tim?"</p>

<p>Tim opened his eyes and grinned weakly.
"Hear the birdies sing, Don! It was a lovely
punch! Help me up, will you?"</p>

<p>Don lifted him to the window-seat. "I'm horribly
sorry, Tim," he said abjectedly. "I&mdash;I
didn't know what I was doing, chum! I wish&mdash;I
wish you'd hand me one, Tim! Go on, will
you?"</p>

<p>Tim laughed weakly. "It's all right, Donald.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Just give me a minute to get my breath. Gee,
things certainly spun around there for a second!"</p>

<p>"Where'd I hit you?"</p>

<p>"Right on the point of the jaw." Tim felt of
the place gingerly. "No harm done, though. It
just sort of&mdash;jarred me a bit. What time is it?"</p>

<p>Don glanced at the tin alarm clock on his
dresser. "Ten of seven," he answered. "What's
that got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Well, you can't make the seven-one now, Donald,
unless you fly all the way, can you?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Don, rather blankly. "I&mdash;I'd forgotten!"</p>

<p>"Good thing," muttered Tim. "Wish you'd
forgotten before! If anyone ever tells you you're
a nice good-natured, even-tempered chap, Don,
don't you believe him. You send 'em to me!"</p>

<p>"I didn't know I could lose my temper like
that," replied the other shamefacedly. "Timmy,
I'm most awfully sorry about it. You believe that,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" Tim laughed. "But I'll bet you're not
half as sorry as you would have been tomorrow
if I'd let you go! Don, you're an awful ass, now
aren't you?"</p>

<p>Don nodded. "I guess I am, Timmy. And
you're a&mdash;a brick, old man!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh! Any more trains to New York tonight?"</p>

<p>"There's one at twelve-something," answered
Don, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Thinking of catching it?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit!"</p>

<p>"All right then." Tim dug in his pocket and
then tossed the door-key beside him on the cushion.
"Better unpack your bag, you silly ass.
Then we'll go out and get some air. I sort of
need it!"</p>

<p>Some three hours later Tim, tossing back his
bed-clothes, exclaimed: "Hello! What have we
here?"</p>

<p>"That's just a note I wrote you," said Don hurriedly.
"Hand it here, Tim."</p>

<p>"I should say not! I'm going to read it!"</p>

<p>"No, please, Tim! It's just about two or three
things I was going to leave you! Hand it over,
like a good chap!"</p>

<p>"Something you were going to leave me?" said
Tim as he let Don wrest the sheet of paper from
him. "Oh, I see. Well,"&mdash;he felt carefully of the
lump on his chin&mdash;"I guess you left me enough as
it is, dearie!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>AMY APPEARS FOR THE DEFENCE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Practice</span> on Monday was a wretched affair. To be
sure, many of the fellows who had played in the
Chambers game had been excused, but that didn't
account for the fact that those who did take part
went at their work as if half asleep. Both McPhee
and Cotter failed to get any life into the first, and
the second, while it, too, seemed to have taken
part in the general slump, managed to score twice
while the first was with difficulty wresting three
touchdowns from its opponent. Mr. Robey
shouted himself red in the face, Steve Edwards,
who followed practice, pleaded and exhorted, and
a stocky, broad-shouldered, bearded individual
who made his appearance that afternoon for the
first time frowned and shook his head, and all to
small purpose. The players accepted scoldings
and insults as a donkey accepts blows, untroubledly,
apathetically, and jogged on at their own
pace, guilty of all the sins of commission and omission
in the football decalogue.</div>

<p>There was much curiosity about the newcomer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and many opinions as to his identity were hazarded
on the bench that afternoon. It was quite
evident that he was a football authority, for Coach
Robey consulted him at times all during practice.
And it was equally evident that they were close
friends, since the stranger was on one occasion
seen to smite the head coach most familiarly between
the shoulders! But who he was and what
he was doing there remained a secret until after
supper. Then it became known that his name was
Proctor, Doctor George G. Proctor, that he was a
practising physician some place in the Middle
West and that he was visiting Coach Robey. But
that was unsatisfactory data and some enterprising
youth hunted back in the football records
and, lo, the mystery was explained. Eight years
before "Gus" Proctor had played tackle on the
Princeton eleven and in his junior and senior
years had been honoured with a position on the
All-American Team. Subsequently he had
coached at a college in Ohio and had put said college
on the map. Now, having stolen away from
home to see Princeton and Yale play next Saturday,
he was staying for a day or two with Mr.
Robey. After that became generally known Doctor
Proctor was gazed at with a new respect whenever
he appeared on field or campus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Don and Tim went up to Number 12 that night
after supper to call on Tom Hall. Tim was having
hard work making Don face the music. If Don
could have had his way he would have kept to himself,
but Tim insisted on dragging him around.
"Just keep a firm upper lip, Donald," he counselled,
"and show the fellows that there's nothing
in it. That's the only way to do. If you keep
skulking off by yourself they'll think you're
ashamed."</p>

<p>"So I am," muttered Don.</p>

<p>"You're not, either! You've done nothing to
be ashamed of! Keep that in mind, you silly It.
Now come along and we'll go up and jolly Tom
a bit."</p>

<p>Steve Edwards was not at home, but Amy Byrd
was enthroned on the window-seat when they entered
in response to Tom's invitation, and Amy
had evidently been holding forth very seriously
on some subject.</p>

<p>"Don't mind us," said Tim. "Go ahead, Amy,
and get it off your chest."</p>

<p>"Hello," said Amy. "Hello, Don, old man.
Haven't seen you for an age. Make yourselves
at home. Never mind Tom, he's only
the host. How did you like the practice today,
Tim?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't see it, but I heard enough about it.
It must have been fierce!"</p>

<p>"It was perfectly punk," growled Tom. "I
should think Robey would want to throw up his
hands and quit!"</p>

<p>"Did you see it, Don?" asked Amy.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't go over. What was the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm no expert," replied Amy, taking his
knees into his arms and rocking gently back and
forth on the seat, "but I'd say in my ignorant way
that someone had unkindly put sleeping-potions in
the milk at training-table! The only fellow who
seemed to have his eyes more than half open was
McPhee. Mac showed signs of life at long intervals.
The rest sort of stumbled around in their
sleep. I think Peters actually snored."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're going to get a fine old drubbing next
Saturday," said Tom pessimistically. "And
what a fine exhibition for that chap Proctor! I'll
bet Robey could have kicked the whole team all
the way back to the gym. He looked as though
it would have done him a world of good to have
a try at it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, these things happen," said Tim
cheerfully. "It's only a slump. We'll get
over it."</p>

<p>"Slump be blowed!" said Tom. "This is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
a fine time to slump, five days before the
game!"</p>

<p>"I know that, too, but there's no use howling
about it. What we need, Tom, is to have you get
back there at right guard, old man."</p>

<p>"That's what I've been saying," exclaimed
Amy earnestly. "I want Tom to go to Josh and
ask him to let him play, but he won't. Says it
wouldn't be any good. You don't know whether
it would or not, Tom, until you try it. Look here,
Josh doesn't want us to get beaten Saturday any
more than we want it ourselves, and if you sort
of put it up to him like that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd look well, wouldn't I?" laughed Tom.
"Telling Josh that unless he let me off pro the
team would get licked! Gee, that's some modest,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You don't have to put it like that," replied
Amy impatiently. "Be&mdash;be diplomatic. Tell
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What we ought to do," interrupted Tim, "is
get up a petition and have everyone sign it."</p>

<p>"I thought of that, too," said Amy, "but this
dunder-headed Turk won't stand for even
that."</p>

<p>"Why not, Tom?" asked Don.</p>

<p>"Because."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"And after that?" asked Amy sweetly.</p>

<p>"Well, look here, you chaps." Tom scowled
intently for a moment. "Look here. It's this
way. Josh put a bunch of us on pro, didn't he?
Well, what right have I to go and ask to be let off
just because I happen to be a football man? You
don't suppose those other fellows like it any better
than I do, do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, forget that! I'm one of them, and I'm
having the time of my life. It's been the making
of me, Tom. I'm getting so blamed full of learning
that I'll be able to loaf all the rest of the year;
live on my income, so to say." And Amy beamed
proudly.</p>

<p>"That's all right," answered Tom doggedly,
"but I don't intend to cry-baby. I'm just as much
in it as any of you. If Josh wants to let us all
off, all right, but I'm not going to ask for a&mdash;a
special dispensation!"</p>

<p>"You don't need to," said Tim. "Let the fellows
do it. That has nothing to do with you.
What's to keep us from going ahead and getting
up a petition?"</p>

<p>"Because I ask you not to," replied Tom simply.
"It's only fair that we should all be punished
alike."</p>

<p>"But you're not," said Don.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're not? Why aren't we?" asked Tom in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Because you're getting it harder than Amy
and Harry Westcott and the others," answered
Don quietly. "They aren't barred from any
sport, and you are."</p>

<p>"By Jove, that's a fact!" exclaimed Amy.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but we all got the same sentence," protested
Tom.</p>

<p>"I know you did, but"&mdash;Don smiled&mdash;"put it
like this. I hate parsnips; can't bear them. Suppose
you and I were punished for something we'd
done by being made to eat parsnips three times a
day for&mdash;for a month! You like them, don't you?
Well, who'd get the worst of that? The sentence
would be the same, but the&mdash;the punishment would
be a heap worse for me, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"'Father was right'!" said Tim.</p>

<p>"Oh, father never spoke a truer word!" cried
Amy, jumping up from the window-seat. "That
settles it, Tom! Get some paper, Tim, and we'll
write that petition this minute and I'll guarantee
to get fifty signatures before ten o'clock!"</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the sort," said Tom stubbornly.
"Don talks like a lawyer, all right, but
he's all wrong. And, anyway, I'm out of football
and I'm going to stay out for this year. I've quit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
training and I probably couldn't play if Josh said
I might. So that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, piffle," said Amy. "Quit training!
Everyone knows you never quit training, Tom.
You could go out there tomorrow and play as
good a game as you ever did. Don't talk like a
sick duck!"</p>

<p>"There's no reason why I should play, though.
Pryme's putting up a bully game&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pryme is doing the best he knows how," said
Tim, "but Pryme can't play guard as you can,
Tom, and he never will, and you know it! Now
have a grain of sense, won't you? Just sit tight
and let us put this thing through. There isn't a
fellow in school who won't be tickled to death to
sign that petition, and I'll bet you anything you
like that Josh will be just as tickled to say yes to
it. Whatever you say about Josh Fernald, you've
got to hand it to him for being fair and square,
Tom."</p>

<p>"Josh is all right, sure. I haven't said anything
against him, have I? But I won't stand for any
petition, fellows, so you might as well get that out
of your heads. Besides, my being on the team or
off it isn't going to make a half of one per cent's
difference next Saturday."</p>

<p>There was silence in the room for a moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Then Amy went dejectedly back to the window-seat
and threw himself on it at full length. "I
think you might, Tom," he said finally, "if only on
my account!"</p>

<p>"Why on your account?" laughed Tom.</p>

<p>"Because I'm the guy that got you all into the
mess, that's why. And I've felt good and mean
about it ever since. And now, when we think up a
perfectly good way to&mdash;to undo the mischief I
made, you act like a mule. Think what a relief it
would be to my conscience, Tom, if you got off pro
and went back and played against Claflin!"</p>

<p>"I don't care a continental about your conscience,
Amy. In fact I never knew before that
you had one!"</p>

<p>"I've got a very nice one, thanks. It's well-trained,
too. It&mdash;&mdash;" Amy's voice trailed off into
silence and for the next five minutes or so he took
no part in the conversation, but just laid on the
cushions and stared intently at the ceiling. Then,
suddenly, he thumped his feet to the floor and
reached for his cap.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Most eight," said Tim. "We'd better
beat it."</p>

<p>"What time&mdash;&mdash;" began Amy. Then he
stopped, pulled his cap on his head and literally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
hurled himself across the room and through the
door, leaving the others to gaze at each other
amazedly.</p>

<p>"Well, what's wrong with him?" gasped Tim.</p>

<p>"He's got something in that crazy head of his,"
answered Tom uneasily. "Don't let him start that
petition business, Tim, will you? I don't want to
seem mean or anything, you know, but I'd rather
let things be as they are. Come up again, fellows.
And maybe today's showing doesn't mean anything,
Tim, just as you said. We'll hope so, eh?"</p>

<p>Faculty conferences took place on Monday
evenings at half-past seven in the faculty meeting
room in Main Hall. At such times, with the principal,
Mr. Fernald, presiding at the end of the
long table and all members of the faculty able to
attend ranged on either side, all and sundry matters
pertaining to the government of the school
came up for discussion. The business portion of
the conference was followed by an informal half-hour
of talk, during which many of the students
were subjected to a dissection that would have
surprised them vastly had they known of it. Tonight,
however, the executive session was still
going on and Mr. Brooke, the secretary, was still
making notes at the foot of the table, when there
came a rap at the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Fernald nodded to Mr. Brooke. "See who
it is, please," he said.</p>

<p>The secretary laid down his pen very carefully
on the clean square of blue blotting-paper before
him, pushed back his chair and opened the door a
few inches. When he turned around his countenance
expressed a sort of pained disapprobation.
"It's Byrd, sir," announced Mr. Brooke in a low,
shocked voice. "He says he'd like to speak to
you."</p>

<p>"Byrd? Well, tell him I'm busy," replied the
principal. "If he wants to wait I'll see him after
the conference. Although"&mdash;Mr. Fernald glanced
at the clock&mdash;"it's only four minutes to eight and
he'd better get back to his room. Tell him I'll
see him at the Cottage at nine, Mr. Brooke. As I
was saying," and Mr. Fernald faced the company
again, "I think it would be well to arrange for a
longer course this Winter. Last year, as you'll
recall&mdash;&mdash; Eh? What is it?"</p>

<p>"He says, sir, that it's a faculty matter," announced
Mr. Brooke deprecatingly, "and asks to
be allowed to come in for a minute."</p>

<p>"A faculty matter? Well, in that case&mdash;&mdash;
All right, Mr. Brooke, tell him to come in."</p>

<p>As Amy entered eight pairs of eyes regarded
him curiously; nine, in fact, for Mr. Brooke, closing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the door softly behind the visitor, gazed at him
in questioning disapproval.</p>

<p>"Well, Byrd, what can we do for you?" Mr.
Fernald smiled, doubtless with the wish to dispel
embarrassment. But he needn't have troubled
about that, for Amy didn't look or act in the least
embarrassed. "I'm afraid," continued the principal,
"that I can't offer you a chair, for we're
rather busy just now. What was it you wanted to
speak of?"</p>

<p>"I guess it looks pretty cheeky, sir, for me to
butt in here," replied Amy, with a smile, "but it's
rather important, sir, and&mdash;and if anything's to
be done about it it'll have to be done tonight."</p>

<p>"Really? Well, it does sound important. Suppose
you tell us about it, Byrd."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir." Amy paused, gathering his
words in order. "It's this, Mr. Fernald: when
we fellows were put on pro&mdash;probation, I mean, it
was intended that we should all get the same punishment,
wasn't it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Let me see, that was the affair of&mdash;&mdash; Ah, yes,
I recall it. Why, yes, Byrd, naturally it was meant
to treat you all alike. What complaint have
you?"</p>

<p>"It isn't exactly a complaint, sir. But it's this
way. There were nine of us altogether. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
my fault in the first place because I put them up to
it. They'd never thought of it if I hadn't." Amy
glanced at Mr. Moller. "It was a pretty silly piece
of business, sir, and we got what we deserved.
But&mdash;but none of us meant to&mdash;to hurt anyone's
feelings, sir. It was just a lark. We didn't think
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll allow that, Byrd. Please get down to
the purpose of this unusual visit," said Mr.
Fernald drily.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Well, eight of us it doesn't matter
so much about. We aren't football men and being
on probation doesn't cut so much&mdash;I mean it
doesn't matter so much. But Tom Hall's a football
man, sir, and it's different for him. This is
his last year here and losing his place on the team
was hard lines. That's what I'm trying to get at,
sir. You meant that we were all to be punished
the same, but we weren't. It's just about twice
as hard on Tom as it is on the rest of us. You see
that, sir, don't you?"</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence and then Mr.
Simkins coughed. Or did he chuckle? Amy
couldn't tell. But the principal dropped his eyes
and tapped his blotter with the tip of the pencil he
held. At last:</p>

<p>"That's a novel point of view, Byrd," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
"There may be something in it. But I must remind
you that the Law&mdash;and the faculty stands for
the Law here&mdash;takes no cognisance of conditions
existing&mdash;hem!" Mr. Fernald glanced doubtfully
down the table. "Perhaps it should, though.
We'll pass that question for the moment. What
is it you suggest, Byrd?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, the team's in punk shape. It was
awful today. It needs Tom, sir; needs him
awfully. I don't say that we'll beat Claflin if he
should play, Mr. Fernald, but I'm mighty sure we
won't if he doesn't. And it seemed to me that
maybe you and the other faculty members hadn't
thought of how much harder you were giving it to
Tom than to the rest of us, and that if you did
know, realise it, sir, you'd maybe consider that
he'd had about enough and let him off so he
might play Saturday. The rest of us haven't any
kick coming, sir. It's just Tom. And he doesn't
know that I'm here, either. We tried to get him
to let us petition faculty, but he wouldn't. He said
he was going to take the same punishment as the
rest of us."</p>

<p>"Then he doesn't agree with your contention,
Byrd?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he sees I'm right, Mr. Fernald, but he&mdash;he's
obstinate!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Fernald smiled, as did most of the others.</p>

<p>"Byrd, I think you ought to take a law course,"
said the principal. "I might answer you as I
started to by pointing out that it is no business of
ours whether a punishment is going to hit one fellow
harder than another; that just because it
might should make that one fellow more careful
not to transgress. But you've taken the wind out
of my sails by getting me to testify that we intended
the punishment to be the same for all.
You've put us in a difficult place, Byrd. If we
should lift probation in Hall's case it would seem
that we had different laws for team members than
for boys unconnected with athletics. You've made
a very eloquent plea, but I don't just see&mdash;&mdash;"
Mr. Fernald hesitated. Then: "Possibly someone
has some suggestion," he added, and it seemed to
Amy that his gaze rested on Mr. Moller for an
instant.</p>

<p>At all events it was the new member of the faculty
who spoke. "If I might, sir," he said hesitatingly,
"I'd like to make the suggestion that
probation be lifted from all. It seems to me that
that would&mdash;would simplify things, Mr. Fernald."</p>

<p>"Hm. Yes. Possibly. As the target of the
extremely vulgar proceeding, Mr. Moller, the suggestion
coming from you bears weight. Byrd,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
you'd better get to your studies. You'll learn our
decision in the morning. Your action is commendable,
my boy, and we'll take that into consideration
also. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir. Good-night, sirs. Thank
you."</p>

<p>Amy retired unhurriedly, unembarrassedly, and
with dignity, as befitted one who had opened the
eyes of Authority to the error of its ways!</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Fernald announced in
chapel that at the request of Mr. Moller, and in
consideration of good behaviour, the faculty had
voted to lift probation from the following students:
Hall&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But just there the applause began and the other
eight names were not heard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE DOCTOR TELLS A STORY</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, with the return of all first-string players
to the line-up and the appearance of Tom Hall
once more at right guard, practice went about a
hundred per cent better, and those who turned
out to watch it went back to the campus considerably
encouraged. The showing of the team
naturally had an effect on the spirit of the mass
meeting that evening. Ever since the Southby
game the school had been holding meetings and
"getting up steam" for the Claflin contest, but
they had been tame affairs in contrast with tonight's.
Brimfield was football-crazy now, for
the Big Game loomed enormous but four days
away. Fellows read football in the papers, talked
football and, some of them, dreamed football.
The news from Claflin was read and discussed
eagerly. The fortunes of the rival eleven were
watched just as closely as those of the home team.
When a Claflin player wrenched an ankle Brimfield
gasped excitedly. When it was published
that Cox, of the blue team, had dropped fourteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
goals out of twenty tries from the thirty-five-yard
line and at a severe angle, depression prevailed at
Brimfield. The news that the Claflin scrubs had
held the first to only one touchdown in thirty minutes
of play sent Brimfield's spirits soaring! Fellows
neglected lessons brazenly and during that
week of the final battle there was a scholastic
slump that would undoubtedly have greatly
alarmed the faculty if the latter, rendered wise by
experience, hadn't expected it.</div>

<p>The first team players were excused from study
hour subsequent to Monday in order that they
might attend blackboard lectures and signal drills
in the gymnasium. On Tuesday night, after an
hour's session, and in response to public clamour,
they filed onto the platform just before the meeting
was to begin at nine-fifteen and, somewhat
embarrassedly, seated themselves in the chairs
arranged across the back. Mr. Fernald was there,
and Mr. Conklin, the athletic director, and
Coaches Robey and Boutelle, and Trainer Danny
Moore, and Manager Morton and Childers, captain
of the baseball team. And Steve Payne was
at the piano. Also, sitting beside Mr. Robey, was
Doctor Proctor.</p>

<p>Childers, who was cheer leader that Fall, presided,
and, after the assemblage had clapped and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
shouted "A-a-ay!" as each newcomer appeared
on the platform, opened proceedings with the
School Song. Then Mr. Fernald spoke briefly,
Captain Edwards followed, each being cheered
loudly and long, and Childers introduced Mr.
Robey. "What we are all anxious to know tonight,"
said Childers, "is whether we're going
to win next Saturday. Mr. Fernald has said that
he <i>hopes</i> we shall, Captain Edwards has said that
he <i>thinks</i> we shall, and now we're going to hear
from the only one who <i>knows!</i> Fellows, a long
cheer for Mr. Robey, and make it good! Are you
all ready? Now then! One&mdash;two&mdash;three!"</p>

<p>"Brimfield! Brimfield! Brimfield! Rah, rah,
rah! Rah, rah, rah! Rah, rah, rah! Brimfield!
Brimfield! Brimfield! Robey!"</p>

<p>When the cheering, and the shouting and clapping
and stamping that followed for good measure,
had quieted down, Mr. Robey said: "Fellows,
Captain Childers is much too flattering. I'm not
gifted with second-sight, even if he thinks so. I
don't know any more than he does or you do
whether we're going to win on Saturday. Like
Mr. Fernald, I <i>hope</i> we are and, like Captain Edwards,
I <i>think</i> we are." Cheers interrupted then.
"But I don't want to make any prediction. I'll
say one thing, though, and that is this: If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
team plays the way it <i>can</i> play, if it makes full
use of the ability that's in it, there's only one
thing that can happen, and that's a Brimfield victory!
I've got every reason to expect that the
team <i>will</i> do its utmost, and that is why I say that
I think we'll win. We must remember that we're
going up against a strong team, a team that in
some ways has shown itself so far this season our
superior. I don't say that the Claflin eleven is
any better than ours. I don't <i>think</i> so, not for a
moment. Our team this Fall is as good as last
year's team. We've had our little upsets; we
always do; but we've come down to practically the
eve of the game in good shape. Every fellow has
done his best and, I am firmly convinced, is going
to do a little better than his best on Saturday
afternoon. And that little better is what will decide
the game, fellows. After the coaches have
done their part and the players have toiled hard
and earnestly and enthusiastically, why then it
all comes down to <i>fight!</i> And so it's fight that's
going to win the game.</p>

<p>"You fellows must do your part, though. You
must be right back of the team, every minute&mdash;and
let them know it. Cheering helps a team to
win, no matter what anyone may say to the contrary.
Only cheer at the right times, fellows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Just making a noise indiscriminately is poor stuff.
But I don't need to tell you this, I guess, because
your cheer leader knows what to do better than I
do. But let the team know that you're right with
them, backing them up all the time, fighting behind
them, boosting them along! It counts, fellows,
take my word for it!</p>

<p>"And now there's one other thing I want to say
before I make way for someone who can really
talk. It's this, fellows. Don't forget the team
that has helped us all season, the team that
doesn't get into the limelight. And don't forget
the coach, who has worked just as hard, perhaps
a good deal harder, to develop that team than I've
worked. I'm going to ask you to show your appreciation
of the unselfish devotion of Coach
Boutelle and one of the finest second teams Brimfield
has ever had!"</p>

<p>Mr. Robey bowed and retreated and Childers
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"A cheer for Coach Boutelle, fellows!" he
shouted. "A long cheer and a whopper!" And,
when it had been given lustily: "And now one
for the second team!" he cried. "Everyone into
it! One&mdash;two&mdash;three!" The enthusiasm was
mounting high now, and, after the cheer had died
away, there were demands for a song. "We want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
to sing!" proclaimed the meeting. "<i>We want to
sing!</i>"</p>

<p>Childers held up a hand. "All right, fellows!
Just a minute, please! We've got a guest with us
this evening, an honoured guest, fellows. Those
of you who know football history know his name
as well as you know the names of Heffelfinger and
DeWitt and Coy and Brickley and&mdash;and many
others in the Football Hall of Fame! I know you
want to hear from him and I hope he will be willing
to say a few words." Childers glanced at Doctor
Proctor and the latter, smiling, shook his head
energetically. "He says he will be glad to, fellows,"
continued Childers mendaciously, amidst
laughter, "and so I'm going to call first for a cheer
for&mdash;if the gentleman will pardon me&mdash;'Gus'
Proctor, famous Princeton and All-America
tackle, and after that we're going to listen very
attentively to him. Now, then, everyone into this!
A long cheer for Doctor Proctor!"</p>

<p>"I'm an awfully poor speaker, fellows," began
the doctor, when he had advanced to the front of
the platform. "I appreciate this honour and if I
don't do justice to the fine reputation your&mdash;your
imaginative cheer leader has provided me with
you must try to forgive me. Speaking isn't my
line. If any of you would like to have a leg sawed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
off or something of that sort I'd be glad to do it
free of charge just to prove that&mdash;well, that
there's something I <i>can</i> do fairly decently!</p>

<p>"I saw your team practice yesterday and I
thought then that perhaps an operation would
benefit it. Then I saw it again today and discovered
that my first diagnosis was wrong. Fellows,
I call it a good team. I think you've got material
there that's equal to any I've ever seen on a school
team. Your coach says he won't prophesy as to
your game on Saturday. I've known George
Robey for ten years. He isn't a bad sort, take him
all around, but he's a pessimist of the most pessimistic
sort. He's the kind of chap who, if you
sprang that old reliable one on him about every
cloud having a silver lining, would shrug his
shoulders and say, 'Humph! More likely nickel-plated!'
That's the sort he is, boys. Now I'm
just the opposite, and, at the risk of displeasing
George, I'm going to tell you that, from what I've
seen of the Brimfield football team in practice,
I'm firmly convinced that it's going to win!"</p>

<p>Loud and prolonged cheering greeted that prediction,
and it was fully a minute before the
speaker could proceed.</p>

<p>"I've played the game in my day and I've
coached teams, boys, and I think I've got a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of what your coach disclaimed. I mean a sort of&mdash;well,
not second-sight, but a sort of ability to
tell what a team will do from the looks of the
players on it. In my profession we have to study
human nature a lot and we get so we can classify
folks after we've looked them over and watched
them awhile. We make mistakes sometimes, but
on the whole we manage fairly well to put folks
in the classes they belong in. Doing that with
the members of your team I find that almost without
exception they class with the kind of fellows
who <i>don't like to be beaten!</i> And when a fellow
doesn't like to be beaten he isn't&mdash;not very often.</p>

<p>"I think I can read in the faces I see here tonight
a great deal of that same spirit, and if the
team has it and you fellows behind the team have
it, why, I wouldn't give a last year's plug-hat for
Claflin's chances next Saturday!</p>

<p>"Football," continued Doctor Proctor presently,
"is a fine game. It's fun to play and it's a
wonderful thing to train a fellow's body and mind.
I've heard lots of folks object to it on various
scores, but I've never heard an objection yet that
carried any weight. More often than not those
who run football down don't know the game. Why,
if it did no more than teach us obedience and
discipline it would be worth while. But it does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
far more than that. It gives us strong, dependable
bodies, it teaches us to think&mdash;and think
quick, and it gives us courage, physical and moral.
I'm going to tell you of an incident that I witnessed
only a few weeks since if you'll let me. I
fear I'm taking up too much time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There were cries of "No, no!" and "Go
ahead!"</p>

<p>"I'll try to be brief. Last Fall I was travelling
on a train out my way, to be exact some eighty
miles west of Cincinnati, when we had an accident.
A freight train was slow about taking a
side track and we came along and banged into it.
It was about five o'clock in the morning and most
of the passengers were asleep. A wreck's a nasty
thing in any case, but when it happens at night or
before it is light enough to see it is worse. The
forward cars of our train and the freight caught
fire from the engines, and there was a good deal
of loose steam around, and things were pretty
messy for awhile. There happened to be another
doctor on the train and, as soon as we got our
bearings, we started a first-aid camp alongside the
track. Some of the passengers, mostly in the day
coaches up front, were badly burned and we had
our hands full.</p>

<p>"There is always more or less confusion in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
affair of that sort and it was some minutes after
the accident before the rescue work got under way.
But one of the first rescuers I noticed was a young
chap, a boy in fact, probably about seventeen
years old. He didn't have a great deal on, I remember,
but he was certainly Johnny-on-the-spot
that morning! It was he who brought the first patient
to me, a little dried-up Hebrew peddler I
judged him, who had been caught under some
wreckage in the forward day-coach. He had a
broken forearm and while I was busy with him I
saw this young chap climbing in and out of windows
and wading through wreckage and always
coming out again with someone. How many folks
he pulled away from the flames and the scalding
steam I don't know, but I never saw anyone work
harder or more&mdash;more efficiently. Yes, efficiently
is just the word I want! And I said to myself at
the time: 'That fellow is a football man! And
I'll bet he's a good one!' You see, it wasn't only
that he had courage to risk himself, but he had the
ability to see what was to be done and to do it,
and do it quick! Why, he was pulling injured
women and children and men from those burning,
overturned cars before a grown-up man had
sensed what had happened! And later on, when
we'd done what we could for the burned and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
scalded bodies and limbs, I got hold of the boy for
a moment. I asked him his name and he told it,
and then I said: 'You've played football, haven't
you?' And he said he had, a little. He wasn't
much of a talker, and when some of us said some
nice things about what he had done he got horribly
fussed and tried to get away. But someone
wanted to shake hands with him, and he wouldn't,
and I saw that his own hand was burned all inside
the palm, deep and nasty. 'How did you do
that?' I asked him as I dressed it. Oh, he didn't
know. He thought he'd got his hand caught between
some beams or something; couldn't get it
out for a minute. It wasn't much of a burn! Well,
the wrecking train and a hospital train came along
about then and I lost sight of that chap, and I
didn't see him again.</p>

<p>"I've told the story because I think it bears me
out when I say that football is fine training. I
don't say that that boy wouldn't have been just as
brave and eager to help if he hadn't been a football
player, but I do maintain that he wouldn't
have known what to do as readily or how to do it
and wouldn't have got at it as quickly. And when
the flames are eating their way back from car to
car quickness means a whole lot! That's the end
of my story, boys. But while I've been telling it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
I've been looking for some sign to tell me that
you recognised the hero of it. I don't find the
sign and I'm puzzled. Perhaps you're so accustomed
to heroes here at Brimfield that one more
or less doesn't stir you. For the satisfaction of
my own curiosity I'm going to ask you if you
know who I've been talking about."</p>

<p>A deep silence was the only answer. The doctor's
audience looked extremely interested and
curious, but no one spoke.</p>

<p>"I see. You don't know. Well, perhaps I'd
better not tell then." But a chorus of protest
arose. The doctor hesitated, and his gaze seemed
to rest intently on a spot at one side of the hall
and about half-way back. Finally, when silence
had fallen again: "I guess I will tell," he said.
"It can't do him or you any harm. It may help
a little to know that there's one amongst you fine
enough to do what I've described. I've never
seen that boy from the moment the wrecking train
reached the scene of the wreck until tonight, and
so I've never spoken to him again. But as I sat
on the platform here awhile ago I looked and saw
him. I don't forget faces very easily, and as you
can understand, I wasn't likely to forget his. As
I say, I haven't spoken to him yet, but I'm going
to now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a silence in which a dropped pin
would have made a noise like a crowbar. Half the
audience had turned their heads in the direction
of Doctor Proctor's smiling gaze, but all eyes were
fixed on his lips. The breathless silence lengthened.
Then the doctor spoke.</p>

<p>"How is your hand, Gilbert?" he asked.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>COACH ROBEY IS PUZZLED</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Some</span> twenty minutes later Don dropped into a
chair in Number 6 and heaved a deep sigh of
relief. "Gee," he muttered, "I wouldn't go
through that again for&mdash;for a million dollars!"</div>

<p>Tim chuckled as he seated himself beyond the
table. "Why not?" he asked innocently. "I
thought everyone treated you very nicely."</p>

<p>A smile flitted across Don's face. "I suppose
they did, only&mdash;I guess that was the trouble! I
felt like an awful fool, Tim! Look here, what did
he have to go and tell everything he knew for? I
was afraid he was going to and I wanted like anything
to sneak out of there, but the place was so
quiet I didn't have the nerve! At first I didn't
suspect that he had seen me. I didn't recognise
him until he stood up to speak this evening. Yesterday
I thought he looked sort of familiar, but I
couldn't place him. He&mdash;he talks too much!"</p>

<p>"He said some awfully nice things about you,
old man."</p>

<p>"He said a lot of nonsense, too! Exaggerated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the whole thing, he did. Why, to listen to him
you'd think I saved about a thousand people from
certain death! Well, I didn't. I helped about six
or seven folks out of those cars. They were sort
of rattled and didn't seem to know enough to
beat it."</p>

<p>"They weren't in any danger, then?"</p>

<p>"No, not much. All they had to do was crawl
out of the way."</p>

<p>"Then they weren't any of them burned, Don?"</p>

<p>"A few were."</p>

<p>"How about the man with the broken arm?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he'd got caught somehow." Don looked
up and saw Tim's laugh. "Well," he added defensively,
"he needn't have told about it like that,
right out in front of the whole school, need
he?"</p>

<p>"You bet he need! Donald, you're a bloomin',
blushin' hero, and we're proud of you! And when
I say blushing I mean it, for you haven't stopped
yet!"</p>

<p>"I guess you'd blush," growled Don, "if it happened
to you!"</p>

<p>"I dare say, but it never will. <i>I'll</i> never have
the whole school get up on their feet and cheer me
like mad for three solid minutes! And I'll never
have Josh shake my hand off and beam at me and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
tell me I'm a credit to the school! Such beautiful
things are not for poor little Tim!"</p>

<p>Don sighed. "Well, it's over with, anyway."</p>

<p>"Over with, nothing! It won't be over with as
long as you stay here, Donald. A hero you are and
a hero you remain, old chap. And&mdash;and I'm
mighty proud of you, you old humbug! Telling
us you didn't do anything but help lug folks to the
relief train, or something!"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that," replied Don defensively.</p>

<p>"You let us think it. Gee, if I'd done anything
like that I'd have put it in the papers!" Tim
chuckled and then went on seriously. "You don't
need to worry about the fellows thinking you a
quitter any more, do you? I guess Proctor settled
that once and for all, Don. And suppose you'd
run away home the other night. This wouldn't
have happened and fellows would have said you
had a yellow streak. I guess it was a mighty
lucky thing you have little Tim to look after you,
dearie!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad I didn't," said Don earnestly. "I'd
have made a worse mess of it, shouldn't I? I&mdash;I'm
sorry you got that punch, though, Timmy."</p>

<p>"Forget it! It was worth it! Being the room-mate
of a hero atones for everything you ever did
to me, Donald. I'm that proud&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>But Tim didn't finish, for Don started around
the table for him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At the time this conversation was taking place
Mr. Robey and Doctor Proctor were walking back
to the former's room in the village through a
frosty, starlit night.</p>

<p>"You certainly managed to spring a sensation,
Gus," observed the coach as they turned into the
road.</p>

<p>"I should say so! Well, that boy deserved all
the cheering and praise he received. And I'm
glad I told that story."</p>

<p>"Well, it's got me guessing," responded the
other. "Look here, Gus, take a chap like the one
you described tonight. What would you think if
he quit cold a week before the big game?"</p>

<p>"Quit? How do you mean, George?"</p>

<p>"Just that. Develops an imaginary illness.
Tells you he doesn't feel well enough to play, in
spite of the fact that he has nothing more the
matter with him than you or I have. Probably
not so much. Shows absolute relief when you tell
him he's dropped. What would you say to that?"</p>

<p>"You mean Gilbert did that?" Mr. Robey assented.
"I wondered why he wasn't on the platform
with the rest of the team," mused the doctor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
"I'd say there was something queer about
it, George. When did this happen?"</p>

<p>"Last week. Thursday or Friday, I think.
He'd been laid off for a day or so and I thought
he'd gone a bit fine, although he's rather too
phlegmatic to suffer much from nerves. Some of
the high-strung chaps do go to pieces about this
time and you have to nurse them along pretty
carefully. But Gilbert! Well, on Saturday&mdash;yes,
that was the day&mdash;he'd been reported perfectly
fit by the trainer and just as a matter of form I
asked him if he was ready to play. And, by
Jove, he had the cheek to face me and say he
wasn't well enough! It was nonsense, of course.
He'd simply got scared. I told him so and
dropped him. But it's curious that a boy who
could do what you told of this evening could prove
a quitter like that."</p>

<p>"You say he seemed relieved when you let
him go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he showed it plainly."</p>

<p>"That is funny! I wonder what the truth of
it is?"</p>

<p>"Nerves, I suppose. Cold feet, as the fellows
say."</p>

<p>"Never! There's something else, old man, that
you haven't got hold of. Can he play?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Y-yes. Yes, he can play. He's the sort that
comes slow and plays a bit logy, but he's steady
and works hard. Not a brilliant man, you know,
but dependable. He's been playing guard.
Losing him has left us a bit weak on that side,
too."</p>

<p>"Why not take him back then? Look here,
George, you're a good coach and all that, but
you're a mighty poor judge of human nature."</p>

<p>"Piffle!"</p>

<p>"It's so, though. You've only got to study that
chap Gilbert to see that he isn't the quitting kind.
His looks show it, his manner shows it, the way
he talks shows it. He's the sort that might want
to quit; we all do sometimes; but he couldn't because
he's got stuff in him that wouldn't let him!"</p>

<p>"That's all well enough, Gus, but facts are
facts. Gilbert <i>did</i> quit, and quit cold on me. So
theories don't count for much. And this human
nature flapdoodle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't say he didn't quit. But I do say that
you've made the wrong diagnosis, George. Did
you talk to him? Ask him what the trouble was?
Go after the symptoms?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm no physician. He said he wasn't feeling
well enough to play. I told him we had no
place for quitters on the team. He had nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to say to that. If you think I can feel the pulse
and look at the tongue of every fellow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Doctor Proctor laughed. "And take his temperature
too, eh? No, I don't expect you to do
that, George. But I'll tell you what I would do,
and I'd do it tomorrow too. I'd call around and
see Gilbert. I'd tell him that I wasn't satisfied
with the explanation he'd made and I'd ask him
to make a clean breast of the trouble, for he must
be in some trouble or he wouldn't thank you for
firing him. And then I'd stop cutting off my nose
to spite my face and I'd reinstate him tomorrow
afternoon!"</p>

<p>"Hmph! The trouble with you doctors is that
you're too romantic. You imagine things,
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have to imagine, George. If we stuck to
facts we'd never get anywhere in our profession!
You try a little imagination, old chap.
You're too matter-of-fact. What you can't see
you won't believe in."</p>

<p>"I certainly won't! As the kids say, seeing's
believing."</p>

<p>"Well, there's a very unattractive board fence
across the road, George. On the other side of it
there are shrubs and grass. I can't see them, but
I know they're there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"More likely tin-cans and ashes," grunted Mr.
Robey.</p>

<p>"Pessimist!" laughed the other. "But never
mind; ashes or grass, something's there, and you
can't see it and yet you've got to acknowledge the
existence of it. Now haven't you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, but"&mdash;Mr. Robey laughed&mdash;"I'd
rather see it!"</p>

<p>"Climb the fence and have a look then! But
you'll try my plan with the boy, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will. If only to satisfy my curiosity,
Gus. Hang it, the chap <i>can't</i> be a quitter!"</p>

<p>"He isn't. I'll stake my reputation as&mdash;as a
romanticist on that! I'd like mighty well to stay
and solve the mystery with you, but I'll have to
jump for that early train. I wish, though, that
you'd drop me a line and tell me the outcome.
I'm interested&mdash;and puzzled."</p>

<p>"All right. I'm not much of a letter-writer,
though. I'll see you before you go back and tell
you about it. You'll be in New York on Sunday,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"Until two o'clock. Have lunch with me and
see me off. Come to the hotel as early as you can
and we'll hold post-mortems on the games. Let's
hope that Princeton and Brimfield both win next
Saturday, George!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>CROSS-EXAMINATION</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Don</span> found being a hero an embarrassing business
the next day. The masters bothered him by stopping
and shaking hands and saying nice things,
and the fellows beamed on him if they weren't
well enough acquainted to speak and insisted on
having a full and detailed history of that train-wreck
if they were! Of course they all, masters
and students, meant well and wanted to show
their admiration, but Don wished they wouldn't.
It made him feel horribly self-conscious, and
feeling self-conscious was distinctly uncomfortable.
At breakfast table his companions referred
to last evening's incident laughingly and poked
fun at Don and enjoyed his embarrassment, but
it wasn't difficult to tell that Doctor Proctor's
narrative had made a strong impression on them
and increased their liking for Don. When, just
before Don had finished his meal, Mr. Robey left
the training-table and crossed the room toward
him he braced himself for another scene in which
he would have to stand up and be shaken by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
hand, and possibly, and worst of all, listen to some
sort of an apology from the coach. But Don was
spared, for Mr. Robey only placed a hand on the
back of his chair, included the rest of the occupants
of the table in his "Good-morning," and said
carelessly: "Gilbert, I wish you'd drop over to
Mr. Conklin's office some time this morning and
see me. What time can you come?"</div>

<p>"Half-past ten, sir?"</p>

<p>"That will be all right, thanks."</p>

<p>The coach returned to his table, leaving Don
wondering what was up. Possibly, he thought,
the coach wanted to make some sort of retraction
of his accusation of Saturday, although Don
didn't believe that Mr. Robey was the sort to funk
a public apology. If it wasn't that it could only
be that he was to be offered his place on the team
again. Don sighed. That would be beastly, for
he would have to tell more fibs, and brand new
ones, too, since not even a blind man would believe
him ill now! It was something of a coincidence
that Don should run across Walton in the corridor
a few minutes later. Don was for passing by
with no recognition of the other, but Walton, with
a smirk, placed himself fairly in the way.</p>

<p>"Great stuff, Gilbert," he said with an attempted
heartiness. "Some hero, eh, what?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Drop it, Walton!" Don lowered his voice,
for others were passing toward the doorway.
"And I'll thank you not to speak to me. You
know my opinion of you. Now shut up!"</p>

<p>Walton found nothing to say until it was too
late. Don approached the gymnasium after his
ten o'clock recitation with lagging feet. He had
scant taste for the impending interview and would
have gladly avoided it if such a thing had been
possible. But he didn't see any way out of it and
he heard the big door bang to behind him with
a sinking heart. Why, he hadn't even thought up
any new excuse!</p>

<p>Mr. Robey and Mr. Conklin, the athletic
director, were both in the latter's room when Don
knocked at the half-opened door. Mr. Conklin
said "Good-morning" and then followed it with:
"I've got something to attend to on the floor,
Robey, if you'll excuse me," and went out, closing
the door behind him. Don wished he had stayed.
He took the chair vacated by the director and
faced Coach Robey with as much ease as he could
assume, which was very little. The coach began
without much preamble.</p>

<p>"I didn't ask you over here to talk about last
night, Gilbert, or to offer you any apology for
what I said on the field last Saturday. I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
believe much in spoken apologies. If I'm wrong
I show it and there's no mistake about it. I think
I was wrong in your case, Gilbert. And I'll say
so, if you like, very gladly, and act so if you'll
prove it."</p>

<p>"I don't want any apology, sir," answered
Don. "I guess you were right enough."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I want to find out. What
<i>was</i> the trouble, Gilbert?"</p>

<p>"Why, just what I said, Coach. I&mdash;I didn't
feel very fit and I didn't think it would be any
use playing, feeling like I did. If you don't feel
well you can't play very well, and so I thought I'd
say so. I didn't mind being dropped, sir. I deserved
it. And&mdash;and that's quite all right." Don
got up, his eyes shifting to the door.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! Let's get the truth of this.
You're lying, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Don tried to look indignant and failed, tried to
look hurt and failed again. Then he gave it up
and dropped his gaze before the searching eyes
of the other. "I'm feeling some better now," he
muttered.</p>

<p>Coach Robey laughed shortly. "Gilbert, you
can't lie worth a cent! Now, look here. I'm
your friend. Why not come across and tell me
what's up? I know you weren't sick. Danny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
gave you a clean bill of health that morning. And
I know you haven't got any nerves to speak of.
There's something else, Gilbert. Now what is it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

<p>"Then why did you act that way?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I just didn't want to play."</p>

<p>"Didn't want to play! Why not?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't doing very well, and it was pretty
hard work, and there was Walton after the place,
too. He could play better than I could."</p>

<p>"Who told you so? Walton?" asked the coach
drily.</p>

<p>"I could see it," murmured Don.</p>

<p>"So you were suddenly afraid of hard work,
eh? It had never bothered you before, had it?
Last year or this year either?"</p>

<p>"No, I guess not."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was more because you felt that
Walton would be a better man for the place,
then?" surmised the coach.</p>

<p>Don agreed eagerly. It was a case of any port
in a storm by now and he was glad enough to have
the coach find an explanation. "Yes, sir, I guess
that was it."</p>

<p>"Well, that was generous of you," said the
other approvingly. "But didn't it occur to you
that perhaps I would be a better one to decide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
that matter than you? You've never known me
to keep a fellow on the team for sentimental reasons,
have you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Hm. Now when was it&mdash;I mean how long before
last Saturday was it&mdash;that you and Walton
talked it over?"</p>

<p>"Sir?" Don looked up startledly. "I&mdash;we&mdash;there
wasn't any talk about it," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Well, what did Walton say?"</p>

<p>Don hesitated, studying Mr. Robey's face in
the hope of discovering how much that gentleman
knew. Finally: "When do you mean?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I mean the time you and Walton talked about
which was the best man for the position," replied
the other easily. To himself he reflected that he
was following Gus Proctor's advice with a vengeance!
But he was by this time pretty certain
of his ground.</p>

<p>"I don't remember that we ever&mdash;exactly did
that," Don faltered. "There was some talk,
maybe, but he&mdash;he never said anything like that."</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>"Why, that he was a better guard."</p>

<p>"Then what put the idea in your head, Gilbert?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose I just saw it myself."</p>

<p>"But you were playing the position pretty regularly
before Thursday or whatever day it was
you were taken ill, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then how could you tell that Walton was better?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He&mdash;he seemed better. And
then Tim told me I was too slow."</p>

<p>"Tim Otis? Otis had better mind his own
business," grumbled the coach. "So that was it,
then. All right. I'm glad to get the <i>truth</i> of the
matter." The little tightening of Don's mouth
didn't escape him. "Now, then, I'm going to surprise
you, Gilbert. I'm going to surprise you
mightily. I'm going to tell you that Walton is <i>not</i>
a better left guard than you. He isn't nearly so
good. That does surprise you, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Don nodded, his eyes fixed uneasily on the
coach's.</p>

<p>"Well, there it is, anyway. And so I think the
best thing for all of us, Gilbert, is for you to come
back to work this afternoon."</p>

<p>Don's look of dismay quite startled the other.</p>

<p>"But I'd rather not, sir! I&mdash;I'm out of practice
now. I've quit training. I've been eating all
sorts of things; potatoes and fresh bread and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
pastry&mdash;no end of pastry, sir!&mdash;and&mdash;and
candy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Robey grunted. "You don't show it," he
said. "Anyway, I guess that won't matter. I'll
chance it. Three o'clock, then, Gilbert."</p>

<p>Don's gaze sought the floor and he shook his
head. "I'd rather not, sir, if you don't mind,"
he muttered.</p>

<p>"But I do mind. The team needs you, Gilbert!
And now that I know that you didn't quit because
you were <i>afraid</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did, though!" Don looked up desperately.
"That was the truth of it!"</p>

<p>Mr. Robey sighed deeply. "Gilbert," he said
patiently, "if I couldn't lie better than you can I
wouldn't try it! You weren't afraid and you
aren't afraid and you know it and I know it! So,
then, is it Walton?"</p>

<p>After a moment Don nodded silently.</p>

<p>"You think he's a better man than you
are, eh?"</p>

<p>Don nodded again, but hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Or you've taken pity on him and want him to
play against Claflin, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. You see, his folks are going to be
here and they'll expect him to play!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. You and Walton come from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
same town? But of course you don't. How did
you know his folks were coming, then?"</p>

<p>"He told me."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"About&mdash;some time last week."</p>

<p>"Was it the day you had that talk about the
position and which of you was to have it?"</p>

<p>"I guess so. Yes, sir, it was that time."</p>

<p>"And he, perhaps, suggested that it would be
a nice idea for you to back out and let him
in, eh?"</p>

<p>Don was silent.</p>

<p>"Did he?" insisted the coach.</p>

<p>"He said that his folks were coming&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that he'd like to get into the game so they
wouldn't be disappointed?"</p>

<p>"Something like that," murmured Don.</p>

<p>"And you consented?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, but I thought it over and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Robey suddenly leaned forward and laid
a hand on Don's knee.</p>

<p>"Gilbert," he asked quietly, "<i>what has Walton
got on you?</i>"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>"ALL READY, BRIMFIELD?"</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Those</span> who braved a chill east wind and went out
that afternoon to watch practice enjoyed a sensation,
for when the first team came trotting over
from the gymnasium, a half-hour later because of
a rigorous signal quiz, amongst them, dressed to
play, was Don Gilbert! A buzz of surprise and
conjecture travelled through the ranks of the shivering
onlookers, that speedily gave place to satisfaction,
and as Don, tossing aside his blanket,
followed the first-string players into the field a
small and enthusiastic First Form youth clapped
approvingly, others took it up and in a moment
the applause crackled along the side line.</div>

<p>"That's for you," whispered Tim to Don.
"Lift off your head-guard!"</p>

<p>But Don glanced alarmedly toward the fringe
of spectators and hid as best he could behind
Thursby! Practice went with a new vim today.
Doubtless the return of Don heartened the team,
for one thing, and then there was a snap of winter
in the air that urged to action. The second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
was as nearly torn to tatters this afternoon as it
had ever been, and the first scored twice in each
of the two fifteen-minute periods. "Boutelle's
Babies" were a lame and tired aggregation when
the final whistle blew!</p>

<p>Later it became known that Walton was out
of it, had emptied his locker and retired from
football affairs for the year. All sorts of stories
circulated. One had it that he had quarrelled
with Coach Robey and been incontinently "fired."
Another that he had become huffy over Gilbert's
reinstatement and had resigned. None save Don
and Coach Robey and Walton himself knew the
truth of the matter for a long time. Don did tell
Tim eventually, but that was two years later, when
his vow of secrecy had lapsed. Just now he was
about as communicative as a sphinx, and Tim's
eager curiosity had to go unsatisfied.</p>

<p>"But what did he <i>say?</i>" Tim demanded after
practice that afternoon. "He must have said
<i>something!</i>"</p>

<p>Don considered leisurely. "No, nothing special.
He said I was to report for work."</p>

<p>"Well, what did <i>you</i> say?"</p>

<p>"I said I would!"</p>

<p>"Well, what about Walton? Where does he
get off?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Tim gestured despairingly. "Gee, you're certainly
a chatty party! Don't tell me any more,
please! You may say something you'll be sorry
for!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you some day all about it, Tim. I
can't now. I said I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Then there is something to tell, eh? I knew
it! You can't fool your Uncle Dudley like that,
Donald! Tell me just one thing and I'll shut up.
Did you and Walton have a row the time you
went to see him in his room?"</p>

<p>Don shook his head. "No, we didn't."</p>

<p>"Well, then, why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You said you'd shut up," reminded the
other.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," grumbled Tim. "Anyway, I'm
mighty glad. Every fellow on the team is as
pleased as Punch. I guess the whole school is,
too. It was mighty decent of Robey, wasn't it?
Do you know, Don, Robey's got a lot of sense
for a football coach?"</p>

<p>Don often wondered what had occurred and
been said at the interview between Mr. Robey and
Harry Walton. The coach had sworn Don to
silence at the termination of their interview. "If
Walton asks you whether you told me about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
business you can say you did, if you like. Or tell
him I wormed it out of you, which is just about
what I did do. But don't say anything to anyone
else about it; at all events, not as long as Walton's
here. I'm going to find him now and have
a talk with him. I don't think you need be at all
afraid of anything he may do after I get through
with him. You fellows clearly did wrong in outstaying
leave that night, but you had a fairly good
excuse and if you'd had enough sense to go to
faculty the next morning and explain you'd have
all got off with only a lecture, I guess. Your mistake
was in not confessing. However, I don't
consider it my place to say anything. It's an old
story now, anyhow. Be at the gym at three with
your togs, Gilbert, and do your best for us from
now on. I'm glad to have you back again. What
I said that afternoon you'd better forget. I'll
show the school that I've changed my mind about
you. I suppose I ought to make some sort of an
apology, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't say anything more about it, sir,"
begged Don.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll say this, Gilbert: You acted like a
white man in taking your medicine and keeping
the others out of trouble. You certainly deserve
credit for that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see it," replied the boy. "I don't see
what else I <i>could</i> have done, Mr. Robey!"</p>

<p>The coach pondered a moment. Then he
laughed. "I guess you're right, at that! Just
the same, you did what was square, Gilbert. All
right, then. Three o'clock." He held out his
hand and Don put his in it, and the two gripped
firmly.</p>

<p>Hurrying back to Main Hall, Don regretted only
one thing, which was that he had in a way broken
his agreement with Walton to say nothing about
their bargain. Coach Robey, though, had pointed
out that the agreement had been terminable by
either party to it, and that in confessing to him
Don had been within his rights. "Walton can
now go ahead and take the matter to faculty, as
he threatened to do," said the coach. "Only,
when I get through talking to him I don't think
he will care to!"</p>

<p>And apparently he hadn't, for no dire summons
reached Don from the office that day or the next,
nor did he ever hear more of the matter. Walton
displayed a retiring disposition that was new and
novel. On such infrequent occasions as Don ran
across him Walton failed to see him. The day of
the game the latter was in evidence with his
father, mother and younger brother; Don saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
him making the rounds of the buildings with them
and he wondered in what manner Walton had
accounted to his folks for his absence from the
football team. Walton stayed on at school, very
little in evidence, until Christmas vacation, but
when the fellows reassembled after the recess he
was not amongst them. Rumour had it that he
had been taken ill and would not be back.
Rumour was proved partly right, at all events,
for Brimfield knew him no more.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The first and second teams held final practice
on Thursday. The first only ran through signals
for awhile, did some punting and catching and
then disappeared, leaving the second to play two
fifteen-minute periods with a team composed of
their own second-string and the first team's third-string
players. After that was over, the second
winning without much effort, the audience, which
had cheered and sung for the better part of an
hour, marched back to the gymnasium and did it
some more, and the second team, cheering most
enthusiastically for themselves and the first and
the school and, last but by no means least, for
Mr. Boutelle, joyously disbanded for the season.</p>

<p>There was another mass-meeting that evening,
an intensely fervid one, followed by a parade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
about the campus and a good deal of noise that
was finally quelled by Mr. Fernald when, in response
to demands, he appeared on the porch of
the Cottage and made a five-minute speech which
ended with the excellent advice to return to hall
and go to bed.</p>

<p>The players didn't attend the meeting that
night, nor were they on hand at the one that took
place the night following. Instead, they trotted
and slithered around the gymnasium floor in rubber-soled
shoes and went through their entire
repertoire of plays under the sharp eyes of
Coaches Robey and Boutelle. There was a blackboard
lecture, too, on each evening, and when, at
nine-thirty on Friday, they were dismissed, with
practice all over for the year, most of them were
very glad to slide into bed as quickly as possible.
If any of them had "the jumps" that night it was
after they were asleep, for the coach had tired
them out sufficiently to make them forget that
such things as nerves were a part of their
system!</p>

<p>But the next morning was a different matter.
Those who had never gone through a Claflin contest
were inclined to be finicky of appetite and to
go off into trances with a piece of toast or a fork-full
of potato poised between plate and mouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Even the more experienced fellows showed some
indication of strain. Thursby, for instance, who
had been three years on the first team as substitute
or first-choice centre, who had already taken
some part in two Claflin games, and who was
apparently far too big and calm to be affected by
nerves, showed a disposition to talk more than
was natural.</p>

<p>Don never really remembered at all clearly how
that Saturday morning passed. Afterward he
had vague recollections of sitting in Clint
Thayer's room and hearing Amy Byrd rattle off
a great deal of nonsensical advice to him and
Clint and Tim as to how to conduct themselves
before the sacrifice (Amy had insisted that they
should line up and face the grand-stand before
the game commenced, salute and recite the immortal
line of Claudius's gladiators: "<i>Morituri
te salutant!</i>"); of seeing Manager Jim Morton
dashing about hither and thither, scowling blackly
under the weight of his duties; of wandering
across to the woods beyond the baseball field with
Tim Otis and Larry Jones and some others and
sitting on the stone wall there and watching Larry
take acorns out of Tim's ears and nose; and,
finally, of going through a perfectly farcical early
dinner in a dining hall empty save for the members<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of the training-table. After that events stood
out more clearly in his memory.</p>

<p>Claflin's hosts began to appear at about half-past
one. They wore blue neckties and arm-bands
or carried blue pennants which they had the good
taste to keep furled while they wandered around
the campus and poked inquisitive heads into the
buildings. Then the Claflin team, twenty-six
strong, rolled up in two barges just before two,
having taken their dinner at the village inn, disembarked
in front of Wendell and meandered
around to the gymnasium laden with suit-cases
and things looking insultingly care-free and
happy, and, as it couldn't be denied, particularly
husky!</p>

<p>Don, observing from the steps of Torrence, wondered
how they managed to appear so easy and
careless. No one, as he confided to Tom Hall and
Tim, would ever suspect that they were about to
do battle for the Brimfield-Claflin championship!</p>

<p>"Huh," said Tom, "that's nothing. That's the
way we all do when we go away to play. It's this
sticking at home and having nothing to do but
<i>think</i> that takes the starch out of you. When you
go off you feel as if you were on a lark. Things
take your mind off your troubles. But, just the
same, a lot of those grinning dubs are doing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
heap of worrying about now. They aren't nearly
as happy as they look!"</p>

<p>"They're a lot happier than they're going to be
about three hours from now," said Tim darkly.
That struck the right note, and Tom and Don
laughed, and Tim laughed with them, and they
all three put their shoulders back and perked up
a lot!</p>

<p>And then it was two o'clock and they were pulling
on their togs in the locker-room; and Danny
Moore was circulating about in very high spirits,
cracking jokes and making them laugh, and Coach
Robey was dispatching Jim Morton and Jim's
assistant on mysterious errands and referring
every little while to his red-covered memorandum
book and looking very untroubled and serene.
And then there was a clamping of feet on the
stairs above and past the windows some two dozen
pairs of blue-stockinged legs moved briskly as
the visitors went across to the field for practice.
And suddenly the noise was stilled and Coach
Robey was telling them that it was up to them
now, and that they hadn't a thing in the world to
do for the next two hours but knock the tar out of
those blue-clad fellows, and that they had a fine
day for it! And then, laughing hard and cheering
a little, they piled out and across the warm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
sunlit grass, past the line of fellow-students and
home-folks and towners, with here and there a
pretty girl to glance shyly and admiringly at them
as they trotted by, and so to the bench. Nerves
were gone now. They were only eager and impatient.
"Squads out!" sang Mr. Robey. Off
came sweaters and faded blankets and they were
out on the gridiron, with Carmine and McPhee
cheerily piping the signals, with their canvas legs
rasping together as they trotted about, and with
the Brimfield cheer sounding in their ears, making
them feel a little chokey, perhaps, but wonderfully
strong and determined and proud!</p>

<p>And presently they were back in front of the
bench, laughing at and pummelling one another,
and the rival captains and the referee were watching
a silver coin turn over and over in the sunlight
out there by the tee in midfield. Behind
them the stand was packed and colourful. Beyond,
Brimfield was cheering lustily again.
Across the faded green, at the end of the newly-brushed
white lines, nearly a hundred Claflin
youths were waving their banners and cheering
back confidently.</p>

<p>"Claflin kicks off," sang Captain Edwards.
"We take the west goal. Come on, fellows!
Everyone on the jump now!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>A long-legged Claflin guard piled the dirt up
into a six-inch cone, laid the ball tenderly upon it,
viewed the result, altered it, backed off and
waited.</p>

<p>"All ready, Claflin? All ready, Brimfield?"</p>

<p>The whistle blew.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>TIM GOES OVER</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Coach Robey</span> put his best foot forward when the
first period started by presenting the strongest
line-up he had. Fortunately, Brimfield had
reached the Claflin game with every first-string
man in top shape, something that doesn't often
happen with a team. There was Captain Edwards
at left end, Thayer at left tackle, Gilbert at left
guard, Thursby at centre, Hall at right guard,
Crewe at right tackle, Holt at right end, Carmine
at quarter, St. Clair at left half, Otis at right
half and Rollins at full.</div>

<p>Opposed to them was a team fully their equal
in age, weight and experience. The Claflin forwards
were a bit taller and rangier, and their centre,
unlike Thursby, was below rather than above
average size. Behind their line, the four players
were, with the exception of Grady, full-back, small
and light. But they were known to be fast and
heady and Claflin didn't make the mistake of underestimating
their ability. The left half, Cox,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
was a broken-field runner of renown as well as
Claflin's best goal-kicker. Perhaps it would have
been difficult that fall to have picked two teams
to oppose each other that were more evenly
matched than those representing the Maroon-and-Grey
and the Blue.</p>

<p>For the first few minutes of play each eleven
seemed to be feeling out its opponent. Two exchanges
of punts gained ground for neither side.
Brimfield got her backfield working then on her
twenty yards and St. Clair and Tim tried each
side of the blue line and in two downs gained a
scant six yards. Rollins punted out at Claflin's
forty-seven. The Blue got past Hall for two
and slid off Holt for three more. The next rush
failed and Claflin punted to Carmine on the fifteen.
The Blue's ends were down on Carmine and he
was stopped for a five-yard gain. Rollins tried a
forward pass to Edwards, but threw short and
the ball grounded. Tim Otis ran the left end for
four and, on a delayed pass, Rollins heaved himself
through centre for the distance, and Brimfield
cheered loudly when the linesmen pulled up stakes
and trailed the chain ten yards nearer the centre
of the field.</p>

<p>A second forward pass was caught by Holt, but
he was brought down for a scant three-yard gain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Once more Rollins attempted the centre of the
blue line, but this time he was stopped short. On
third down Rollins punted and Claflin caught on
her forty and ran the ball back to the middle of
the field. Claflin then found Crewe for four yards
and completed her distance on a straight plunge
between Gilbert and Thayer. It was the Blue's
turn to cheer then and she performed valiantly.
Claflin tried Edwards's end, but made nothing of
it, poked Cox past Crewe for a couple of yards,
made three around Holt and then punted. St.
Clair misjudged the distance and the ball went
over his head and there was a scamper to the goal
line. Carmine finally fell on the ball for a touchback
and the excitement in the stands subsided.
Brimfield smashed Otis at the Blue's centre and
reached the twenty-five-yard line. St. Clair made
three on a skin-tackle play at the right and Rollins
got the distance on a plunge after a fake-kick.
Brimfield again made first down on the forty-two
yards and her supporters howled gleefully. A
moment later they had new cause for rejoicing
when Rollins pegged the ball across the field to
Edwards and the Maroon-and-Grey's captain
scampered and dodged along the side of the field
for thirteen yards before he was tackled. Time
was called for a Claflin back and Brimfield drew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
off for a consultation, the result of which was seen
in the next play.</p>

<p>Carmine called Gilbert to the right side of centre,
the backs spread themselves in wide formation
ten yards behind the line and Steve Edwards,
as the first signal began, ran back, straightened
out as the ball was snapped, raced along behind
his forwards and swept around his right end.
Claflin's right end and half-back plunged outside
of Thayer, were met by St. Clair and Rollins, and
Carmine, having taken the ball on a long pass from
Thursby, raced past them and then swung quickly
in and found an almost clear field ahead.</p>

<p>Two white lines passed under his twinkling
feet and then, near the twenty, he was challenged
by a Claflin back. Carmine eluded him, crossed
a third line, found himself confronted by the
Blue's quarter, attempted to slip by on the outside,
was tackled and borne struggling across the
side line and deposited forcibly on the ground.</p>

<p>When the ball was stepped in by the referee it
was set down some four inches inside the fifteen-yard
line. In the stands and along the side of the
field Brimfield was cheering triumphantly, imploringly,
and waving her banners. The linesmen
scampered in obedience to the referee's waving
arm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"First down!" shouted the official. "All right,
Brimfield? Ready, Claflin?" The whistle piped
again.</p>

<p>Rollins was stopped squarely on a try at right
guard and Otis made a scant three past the left
tackle. Under the shadow of her goal-posts, Claflin
was digging her cleats in the turf and fighting
hard. Rollins went back. "Get through, Claflin!
Block this kick!" cried the Blue's quarter-back.
"<i>Get through! Get through!</i>" Back went the
ball from Thursby, a trifle high but straight
enough, Rollins poised it, swung his leg, and then,
tucking the pigskin under his arm, sprang away
to the left. Shouts of alarm, cries of warning,
the hurried rush of feet and rasping of canvas!
Bodies crashed together and went down. Rollins,
at the ten yards now, side-stepped and got past
a blue-legged defender, turned in and went banging
straight into the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Arms clutched at him.
He was stopped momentarily. Then he wrested
free, plunged on for another yard and went to
earth.</p>

<p>"Second down!" cried the referee when he had
bored through the pile of squirming bodies and
found the ball. He glanced along the five-yard
line, set the pigskin to earth again, and "About
two feet to go!" he added. Brimfield was shouting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
incessantly now, standing and waving.
"<i>Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!</i>" Across
the field Claflin sent back a dogged chant: "<i>Hold
'em, Claflin! Hold 'em, Claflin! Hold 'em, Claflin!</i>"</p>

<p>But surely Claflin couldn't do that! It seemed
too much to ask or expect. Otis made it first down
off left tackle, placing the ball on the three yards.
Before the next play could be started the period
ended and the teams flocked to the water pails and
then tramped down to the other end of the field.
The cheering never paused, even if the playing
did. Childers, red-faced and perspiring, kept the
Brimfield section busy every instant. "Once
more, now! A long cheer with nine 'Brimfields'!
That's good! Keep it up! We're going to score,
fellows! Let's have it again! All into it!"</p>

<p>Only three yards to go and four downs to do
it! Claflin lined up desperately, her forwards digging
their toes barely inside their last line, her
backfield men skirmishing anxiously about behind
it. "Push 'em back, Claflin! You can do it!
Don't give 'em an inch! Stop 'em right here, fellows!
Low, low, get <i>low</i>, you fellows! Charge
into 'em and smother this play!" The Claflin
quarter, pale of face, thumped crouching backs
and watched the foe intently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put it over now!" shrilled Carmine. "Here
we go! Get down there, Hall! Signals!"</p>

<p>Rollins leaped forward, took the ball from Carmine
and smashed straight ahead. There was a
moment of doubt. His plunging body stopped,
went on, stopped, was borne back.</p>

<p>"Second down! Two and a half to go!"</p>

<p>Again the signals, the line shifted, Claflin
changed to meet the shift. St. Clair slewed across
and slammed past the Claflin left tackle. But the
secondary defence had him in the next instant
and he was thrust, fighting, back and still back.
But he had gained. "A yard and a half!" proclaimed
the referee.</p>

<p>"You've got to do it, Brimfield!" shouted Edwards
intensely. "Don't let them get the jump
on you like that! Get into it, Crewe! Watch that
man, Gilbert! Come on now! Put it over!"</p>

<p>"Signals!" shrieked Carmine. "Make it go
this time! Over with it!"</p>

<p>Back went Rollins, hands outstretched. "Fake!"
shouted Claflin. "Watch the ball! Watch the
ball!"</p>

<p>Rollins's arms fell, empty, as St. Clair grabbed
the pigskin and swept wide to the right. "<i>In!
In!</i>" cried Carmine. St. Clair turned and shot
toward the broken line. His interference did its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
part, but the Claflin left end had fooled Holt and
it was that blue-legged youth who got St. Clair
and thumped him to the sod. An anxious, breathless
moment followed. Brimfield called for time
and St. Clair, on his back, kicked and squirmed
while they pumped the air back into his lungs.
The referee, kneeling over the ball, squinted along
the line. Then:</p>

<p>"Fourth down and about two to go!" he announced.</p>

<p>St. Clair had lost a half-yard! Claflin cheered
weakly. Steve Edwards and Carmine consulted.</p>

<p>"We'd better kick it over," said Carmine.
"They're getting the jump on us every time,
Steve." Carmine's voice was husky and he had
to gasp his words out. Steve, panting like an
engine, shook his head.</p>

<p>"We need the touchdown," he said. "We'll
put it over. Try 11. Tim can make it."</p>

<p>St. Clair walked back to his place. The whistle
sounded again. "Come on, Brimfield!" gasped
Carmine. "This is your last chance! If you
don't do it this time you'll never do it! Play like
you meant it! Stop your fooling and show 'em
football! Every man into this and <i>make it go!</i>
Hall over! Signals!" Hall pushed his way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the left of the line. Claflin shuffled to meet the
change. "Signals! 83&mdash;38&mdash;11&mdash;106!"</p>

<p>"<i>Signals!</i>" cried St. Clair. Carmine turned on
him, snarling. "Use your bean! Change signals!
Hall over! 61&mdash;16&mdash;11&mdash;37! 61&mdash;16&mdash;11&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Back shot the ball to the quarter. Off sped St.
Clair around his end, followed by Rollins. Carmine
crouched, back to the line, while he counted
five. Then Tim Otis shot forward, took the delayed
pass, jammed the ball against his stomach
and went in past Thursby on the right.</p>

<p>Tim struck the line as if shot out of a gun.
There was no hole there, but Tim made one. If
the secondary defence, overanxious, had not been
fooled by that fake attack at their end Tim would
never have gained a foot. But as it was Claflin
was caught napping in the centre of her line. Tim
banged against a brawny guard, Carmine, following
him through, added impetus, the Claflin line
buckled inward! Shouts and grunts, stifled groans
of despair from the yielding blue line! Then
Brimfield closed in behind Tim and he was borne
off his feet and on and over to fall at last in a
chaos of struggling bodies well across the goal
line!</p>

<p>The ball went over to the right of the goal and
Carmine decided on a punt-out. Unfortunately,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Thayer juggled the catch and so Brimfield lost her
try-at-goal. But six points looked pretty big just
then and continued to look big all the rest of the
half and during the succeeding intermission.
Brimfield's supporters were confident and happy.
They sang and cheered and laughed, and the sun,
sinking behind the wooded ridge, cast long golden
beams on the flaunting maroon banners.</p>

<p>And then the teams came trotting back once
more and cheers thundered forth from opposing
stands. Howard had taken St. Clair's place, it
was seen, and Claflin had replaced her right guard.
But otherwise the teams were unchanged. Brimfield
kicked off and Claflin brought her supporters
to their feet by running the ball back all the way
to the forty-five-yard line. That was Cox, the
fleet-footed and elusive, and the Blue's left half
got a mighty cheer from his friends and generous
applause from the enemy. After that Claflin tried
a forward pass and gained another down, and
then, from near the middle of the field, marched
down to Brimfield's thirty-three before she was
stopped. The Maroon-and-Grey got the ball on
downs by an inch or two only.</p>

<p>Brimfield tried the Claflin ends out pretty thoroughly
and with Otis and Howard carrying, took
back most of Claflin's gain. But a forward pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
finally went to a Claflin end instead of Holt and
the tables were suddenly turned. It was the
Blue's ball on Brimfield's forty-six then, and
Claflin opened her bag of tricks. Just how Cox
got through the centre of the Brimfield line no one
ever explained satisfactorily, but get through he
did, and after he was through he romped past Otis
and Rollins and raced straight for the goal. Carmine
and Howard closed in on him and it was
Carmine who brought him down at last on the
twelve yards.</p>

<p>How Claflin shouted and triumphed then! The
Blue came surging down the field to line up
against the astounded enemy, determination written
large on every countenance. A plunge at Gilbert
gained a yard and was followed by a three-yard
gain off Holt. Then Claflin fumbled and recovered
for a two-yard loss and, with eight to go
on fourth down, decided that a goal from field
was the best try. And, although Brimfield tried
hard to get through to the nimble-footed Cox, and
did smear the Blue's line pretty fairly, the ball
went well and true across the bar, and the 0 on
the score-board was changed to a 3!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>LEFT GUARD GILBERT</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">That</span> finished the scoring in the third period. All
that Claflin could do was to bring back Brimfield's
punts and try desperately to find holes in the
maroon-and-grey line that weren't there. Both
teams were showing the effects of hard playing,
and when the third quarter ended substitutes were
hurried in from both benches. For Brimfield,
McPhee relieved Carmine, Lee went in for Holt
and Sturges for Crewe. Claflin put in a new right
end, a fresh full-back and returned her original
right guard to the line-up.</div>

<p>McPhee brought instructions from Coach
Robey. Brimfield was to hold what she had and
play the kicking game. If she got within the
Blue's thirty-yard line she was to let Rollins try
a drop-kick.</p>

<p>Rollins punted regularly on second down and
just as regularly Claflin rushed until the fourth
and then punted back. After five minutes of play,
during which the ball went back and forth from
one thirty-yard line to the other, it dawned on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Claflin that she was making no progress. A new
full-back trotted in and displayed his ability by
sending the ball over McPhee's head on his first
attempt. Fortunately, though, the punt, while
long, was much too low, and McPhee had plenty of
time to go after the pigskin, gather it in and run
back a dozen yards before the Claflin ends reached
him. But after that McPhee played further back
and Rollins put still more power into his drives.</p>

<p>With almost ten minutes of the final period
gone, Claflin, grown desperate, tried what forward
passing would do. The first time, she lost the
ball to Thayer, and Clint got ten yards before he
was thrown, but the second attempt went better
and Cox, who made the catch, ran across three
white lines and only stopped when Edwards
dragged him down from behind. Claflin got another
first down by two plunges at the right of the
opponent's line and a wide end-run. Then a penalty
set her back fifteen yards and she had to
punt after two ineffectual attempts at rushing.
Otis got through for five yards and then Rollins
punted again.</p>

<p>The head linesman announced five minutes to
play. On the stands the spectators were beginning
to depart. Claflin was back on her thirty-five
yards, banging desperately at the maroon-and-grey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
line, desperately and a bit hopelessly.
A forward pass was knocked down by Captain
Edwards, an assault at the left of the Brimfield
line was smeared badly, Cox tried the other end
and was laid low for a loss. Claflin punted.</p>

<p>Howard, on a double pass, swept around the
enemy's left for fifteen yards and then squirmed
past tackle for six more. Rollins kicked to Claflin's
ten and Edwards nailed the Blue's quarter
before he could move. Brimfield cheered encouragingly.
But Claflin, after getting four around
Sturges, punted out of danger to Brimfield's
forty-seven.</p>

<p>"Three minutes!" announced the timekeeper.</p>

<p>Otis got two at centre and Rollins again fell
back to kick. The ball came to him low and he
juggled it. Claflin poured through the right of
the line, the ball bounded back from some upthrown
arm and went dancing along the field.
Blue players and maroon dashed after it. Hall
almost had it, but was toppled aside by a Claflin
man. Carmine dived for it and missed. Then
Tim Otis and a Claflin forward dropped upon it
simultaneously and struggled for its possession.
Tim always maintained that he got more of it
than his opponent, and got it first, but the referee
awarded it to Claflin and dismayedly Brimfield<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
gathered together and lined up only twenty yards
from her goal!</p>


<p>"Two minutes, fellows!" shouted the Claflin
quarter-back exultantly. "We've got time to do
it! Come on now, come on! We can win it right
now! All together, Claflin! We've got them on
the run! They're all-in! They're ready to quit!"</p>

<p>The Claflin full-back faked a kick and circled
around Lee's end for a six-yard gain. Then the
Blue's right half plugged the line and got three
more past Hall. It was one to go on third down.
Another attack on Hall was pushed back, but Claflin
made it first down by sending Cox squirming
around Thayer. The ball was on the eleven yards
now. It was Brimfield's turn to know the fear of
defeat. Edwards implored and bullied. Claflin
banged at Gilbert for a yard. A quarter-back run
caught Steve Edwards napping and put the pigskin
on the seven yards. Brimfield's adherents,
massed along the side line, shouted defiantly.
Across the darkening, trampled field, the Claflin
cohorts were imploring a touchdown.</p>

<p>"Third down! Six to go!" shouted the referee,
hurrying out of the way.</p>

<p>"On side, Claflin right end and tackle!" warned
the umpire.</p>

<p>The signals came again and the Claflin full-back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
smashed into the left of the opposing team. But
it was like striking a stone wall that time. Perhaps
the ball nestled a few inches nearer the goal,
but no more than that. It was Don who bore the
brunt of that attack and after the piled-up bodies
had been pulled aside he and the Claflin full-back
remained on the ground. On came the trainers
with splashing buckets. Don came to with the
first swash of the big, smelly sponge on his face.
Danny Moore was grinning down at him.</p>

<p>"Are ye hurt?" he asked.</p>

<p>Don considered that a moment. Then he shook
his head. "I'm&mdash;all right,&mdash;Danny," he murmured.
"Just&mdash;help me&mdash;up."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry. Take all the time the law
allows ye." Danny's fingers travelled inquiringly
over the boy's body. "Where do you feel it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Don kept his eyes stoically on the trainer's. If
he flinched a little when Danny's strong fingers
pressed his right shoulder it was so little that the
trainer failed to see it. Nearby, the Claflin full-back
was already on his feet. Tim came over and
knelt by the trainer's side.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong, Don?" he asked in a tired,
anxious voice.</p>

<p>"Not a thing," replied Don cheerfully. "Give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
me a hand, will you? I'm sort of wabbly, I
guess."</p>

<p>On the side line Pryme, head-guard in hand,
was trotting up and down. Coach Robey was looking
across intently. Don shook himself, stretched
his arms&mdash;no one ever knew what that cost him!&mdash;and
trotted around a few steps. Then, out of the
corner of his eyes, he saw the coach say something
to Pryme, saw the disappointed look on the
substitute's face and was half sorry for him. The
whistle blew again and Don was crouching once
more beside Thursby&mdash;why, no, it wasn't Thursby
any longer! It was Peters, stout, complacent
Peters, wearing a strangely fierce and ugly look
on his round countenance!</p>

<p>"Now hold 'em, Brimfield!" chanted McPhee.
"Hold 'em hard! Don't let them have an inch!"</p>

<p>Far easier said than done, though! A quick
throw across the end of the line, a wild scramble
and jumble of arms, a faint "<i>Down!</i>" and, at the
right end of the Brimfield line, a mound of bodies
with the ball somewhere down beneath and to all
appearances across the goal line! Anxious moments
then! One by one the fallen warriors were
pulled to their feet while into the pile dove the
referee. The timekeeper hovered nearby, watch
in hand. Then the referee's voice:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 291px;">
<img src="images/gs04.jpg" width="291" height="400" alt="The runner smashed into sight, wild-faced for an instant before he put his head down and charged in" title="The runner smashed into sight, wild-faced for an instant before he put his head down and charged in" />
<span class="caption">The runner smashed into sight, wild-faced for an instant before he put his head down and charged in</span>
</div>

<p>"Claflin's ball! First down! A foot to go!"</p>

<p>"Line-up! Line-up!" shrieked the Claflin quarter.
"We've got time yet! Put it over!"</p>

<p>"Fight, Brimfield!" shouted Steve Edwards.
"There's only forty seconds! Hold them off!
Don't let them get it! Tom! Peters! Don! Get
into it now!"</p>

<p>"Signals! Signals!"</p>

<p>Then a moment of silence save for the gasping
breath of the players. The Claflin quarter shouted
his signals, the ball sped back, the lines heaved.
Straight at the left guard position plunged the
back. "<i>Stop him!</i>" growled Peters. The secondary
defence leaped to the rescue. Back went
the man with the ball. "<i>Down!</i>" he cried in
smothered tones. The referee pushed in and
heeled the mark.</p>

<p>"Second down! A foot and a half to go!"</p>

<p>Don knew now that if he had fooled Danny
Moore he had not fooled the Claflin quarter-back.
That quarter knew or guessed that he had been
hurt and was playing for him. Don gritted his
teeth and ground his cleats into the sod. Well,
they'd see!</p>

<p>The signals again, broken into by Steve Edwards's
shrill voice in wild appeal. Steve was wellnigh
beside himself now. Peters was growling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
like a bear in a cage. Then again the plunge, hard
and quick, the whole Claflin backfield behind it!
Don felt an intolerable pain as he pushed and
struggled. Despair seized him for an instant, for
he was being borne back. Then someone hurtled
into him from behind, driving the breath from his
lungs, and he was staggering forward.</p>

<p>Peters was yanking him to his feet, a wild-eyed
Peters mouthing strange exultant words. "They
can't do it! No, never! Not if they were to try
all night! We put 'em back again, Gilbert! We'll
do it again! Come on, you blue-legged babies!
Try it again! You'll never do it!"</p>

<p>Don, dazed, swaying giddily, groped back to his
place. Thayer was muttering, too, now. Don
wondered if they were all crazy. He was quite
certain that he was, for otherwise things wouldn't
revolve around him in such funny long sweeps.
Then his mind was suddenly clear again. The
Claflin quarter was hurling his signals out hurriedly,
despairingly, fighting against time. Don
didn't listen to those signals for he knew where
the attack would come. And he was right, for
once more the blue right guard and tackle sprang
at him to bear him back. And then the runner
smashed into sight, wild-faced for an instant before
he put his head down and charged in. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Don didn't yield. Peters, roaring loudly, was
fighting across him, and, front and rear, reinforcements
hurled themselves into the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Don
closed his eyes, every muscle in his body straining
forward. A roar of voices came to him only dimly.
Ages passed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He wondered if Danny Moore had nothing better
to do than eternally swab his face with that
beastly old sponge! Why didn't he pick on some
other fellow? Don felt quite aggrieved and tried
to say so, but couldn't seem to make any sound.
Then he realised that he had forgotten to open his
lips. When he did he got a lot of cold water in his
mouth and that made him quite peevish. He tried
to raise his right hand, changed his mind about it
and raised his left instead. With that he pushed
weakly at the offending sponge.</p>

<p>"Take it away," he muttered. "I'm&mdash;drowned."</p>

<p>"Can you walk or will we carry you?" asked
Danny in businesslike tones.</p>

<p>"Walk," said Don indignantly. "Let me up."
Recollection returned. "Did they make it?" he
gasped.</p>

<p>"They did not. Lie still a bit."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;" Don's voice grew faint and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
closed his eyes again. The sponge gave a final pat
and disappeared. "What&mdash;what down was that?"
asked Don anxiously.</p>

<p>"Third."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then they've got another! Help me
up, Danny, will you? We've got to stop them, you
know. I don't believe they&mdash;can do it, do you?
We put them back twice, you know."</p>

<p>"Sure you did," said the trainer soothingly.
"Here you are, Tim. Take his feet. And you
get your arm under his middle, Martin. So!
Careful of the shoulder, boys. He's got a fine
broken blade in there!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" Don kicked Tim's hands away from
his ankles as, raised to a sitting posture
by Danny and Martin, his puzzled glance swept
the field. "Where's&mdash;where's everyone?" he
gasped.</p>

<p>"If you mean the team," laughed Tim, "they're
beating it for the gym."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Don. "But&mdash;but what happened?
They didn't"&mdash;his voice sank&mdash;"they didn't do
it, did they, Tim?"</p>

<p>"Of course they didn't, old man! We pushed
them back three times and we'd have done it again
if the whistle hadn't saved them!"</p>

<p>"Then we won!" exclaimed Don.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surest thing you know, dearie! If you don't
believe it listen to that band of wild Indians over
in front of the gym! Now are you ready to be
lugged along?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks," sighed Don.</p>
